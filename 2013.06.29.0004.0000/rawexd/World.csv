Once you have chosen a World, you will not be allowed to move to another,
so if you have made plans to play FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn
with friends, make sure that you all select the same one.

Worlds are divided into two different groups, J and NE/EU, based on the
location of their servers. To ensure you encounter the fewest number of
latency issues, it is recommended, but not required, that you select the
group that is closer to where you will be playing. 

※This World will only be available for the duration of the beta test. ",0
