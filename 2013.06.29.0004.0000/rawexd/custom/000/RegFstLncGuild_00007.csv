1,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A1_000_2","What is the lancer's art?"
4,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_2","I am Ywain, the master of the Lancers' Guild. My charge is to oversee the training of those who seek to master the polearm."
6,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_3","I served as a Wood Wailer until circumstance forced me to hang up my spear. It was then that I took up my post here, upon the recommendation of my former captain."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_4","That was shortly after the Calamity. I must confess that I was none too pleased to leave the front lines at first, but with time I came to appreciate my new role, and now I would not exchange it for any other. To see young lancers fulfilling their potential is a fine thing indeed, and to know that you have helped them is finer still."

9,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_6","A lancer flinches not before his enemies, nor does he know the meaning of fear─yet there is a fine line between courage and folly. If you wish to become a lancer, you must learn to discern one from the other."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_7","There exist myriad fighting styles, each of which has its own unique qualities. None, however, can claim to be as offensively minded as ours. Our approach is ever one of attack, no matter who─or what─we face."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_8","An experienced lancer is able to wield a polearm as if it were an extension of his body. He transforms into a raging storm before his foes, delivering a barrage of devastating thrusts and slashes."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_9","In order to facilitate such a relentless offense, we lancers favor armor of leather and chain mail─such things as provide adequate protection without sacrificing mobility."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_10","The measure of a lancer's worth is truly quite simple: how swiftly and decisively he can pierce the enemy's defenses."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTLNCGUILD_00007_YWAIN_000_11","Very straightforward, I am sure you will agree. For this reason, our art provides the truest reflection of an individual's abilities, be it for good or ill."
