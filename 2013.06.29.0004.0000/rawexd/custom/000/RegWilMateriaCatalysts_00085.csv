1,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_SCENE00000Q","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_SCENE00000A1","What is a catalyst?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_SCENE00000A2","How do I obtain catalysts?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_SCENE00000A3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_KOKOSAMU_000_10","Plainly put, a catalyst is impure dark matter. In case ye don't know what dark matter is, it consists o' fragments o' rocks what fell from the sky ages ago. Owin' to its habit o' bondin' with anythin' it touches, it's commonly used to repair gear."
6,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_KOKOSAMU_000_11","Dark matter's found in nature, an' in various stages o' bondin' with other substances. The stuff what's semi-bonded with coal is called carbonized matter, an' <Emphasis>this</Emphasis>, 'venturer, is our catalyst."
7,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_KOKOSAMU_000_12","Now, carbonized matter's worthless for repairs, but as it turns out, it's essential for meldin' materia. Accordin' to Master Mutamix, this is because it's made up o' both dead an' livin' matter─not unlike materia."
8,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_KOKOSAMU_000_13","Without carbonized matter, there ain't no way to attach materia to gear. An' materia what can't be attached to gear's about as useful as nipples on a breastplate."
9,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_KOKOSAMU_000_20","Havin' fallen from the sky, dark matter's found nigh everywhere. The same goes for carbonized matter, the substance what serves as catalyst. Ye just need the eyes to spot the stuff─the eyes of a Disciple o' the Land."

11,"TEXT_REGWILMATERIACATALYSTS_00085_KOKOSAMU_000_22","The degree o' purity varies dependin' on where ye look, but there's demand for all grades o' carbonized matter. The more ye gather, the richer ye get!"
