1,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_SEQ_01","Blaisette swears she saw a child roaming the depths of the Twelveswood at night. Investigate the scene of the sighting─a tree stump to the north─and put her mind at rest."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_SEQ_02","Upon inspecting the tree stump, you discover an undersized cane. Might it offer a clue as to the identity of the mysterious figure? Return to the Hawthorne Hut and present your find to Blaisette."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_SEQ_03","Blaisette believes the cane you found belongs to a sylph. It would seem she mistook one of their kind for a child. Deliver the cane to a sylph named Komuxio, who abides in Little Solace."
4,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_SEQ_04","Komuxio tells you that the cane does not belong to any of the sylphs in Little Solace. He believes that it may be the property of those whom he calls the “dark ones”─sylphs who have grown malign and dangerous."

50,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_BLAISETTE_000_3","Now, we haven't received word of any missing children, but if there were even a chance... <sigh> Were it not for my duties here, I would be out searching now. Might you investigate in my stead?"

52,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_BLAISETTE_000_12","Ah! You have returned! Tell me all that you have learned!
...Hm? Found this cane at the tree stump, you say? 'Tis far too small for our use. I'd wager it belongs to one of the sylphs of Little Solace, the settlement to the east."
53,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_BLAISETTE_000_13","Well, I suppose that solves the mystery. It would seem that the “child” I saw was in fact a sylph. And I was so worried..."
54,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_BLAISETTE_000_14","At any rate, we should return the cane to its rightful owner. Please take it to a sylph named Komuxio in Little Solace─he will know what to do with it. And while you are there, tell him in no uncertain terms that his people should not wander the forest at night."
55,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_KOMUXIO_000_21","What brings a walking one to the abode of these ones? A cane?"
56,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_KOMUXIO_000_22","It is not of these ones. It belongs to those ones who yet dwell in the homeland."
57,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_KOMUXIO_000_23","Those ones were once like these ones. But those ones have grown dark of heart─dark of heart since those ones summoned a primal one."
58,"TEXT_SUBFST082_00356_KOMUXIO_000_24","Those dark ones now seek to torment these ones. If walking one should ever travel north, beware! Beware the dark ones!"
