1,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_SEQ_01","A sylph has been spotted in the South Shroud, an area that the sylphic clans are known to avoid. Perhaps this wayward sprite is the missing elder sought by Catguistl. You have been advised to travel to Bentbranch Meadows and speak with Keitha─she may have more to say about the sighting."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_SEQ_02","Keitha has little to add to her initial report, but suggests that you try inquiring at the Mirror Planks, a common stopping-place for traveling merchants leaving the South Shroud. Speak with Armelle, a Mirror Planks local, and find out if any interesting rumors are circulating in the settlement."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_SEQ_03","Armelle knows naught of the report which brought you to the Mirror Planks. She does, however, suggest you consult Buscarron, the proprietor of Buscarron's Druthers. Situated in the midst of the South Shroud, the tavern seems an apt place to uncover fresh rumors concerning the displaced sylph."
4,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_SEQ_04","Although Buscarron confirms that a sylph was seen, he cannot be certain it was the elder you seek. He suggests that you remain in the area, making yourself useful around the tavern while you await further developments."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_CATGUISTL_000_2","One of the sylvan folk has been spotted in the South Shroud, a region of the Twelveswood their kind are known to avoid."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_CATGUISTL_000_3","While unusual, the sighting would not under normal circumstances warrant further investigation. The circumstances are <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> normal, however. According to our contacts, the elder of the sylphs has been missing for some time. I trust you understand the potential significance of this fact... We need to know the identity of our wayward sprite. I suggest you begin your investigation by speaking with Keitha at Bentbranch Meadows─she was the individual who made the initial report."
51,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_KEITHA_000_11","Here to ask about that sylph as was spotted in the South Shroud, is it? Aye, I had the news straight from the mouth o' the merchant as saw it."
52,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_KEITHA_000_12","You rarely spot the little troublemakers in that neck o' the woods, so I thought it best to mention the sightin' to the nearest soldier."
53,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_KEITHA_000_13","I know you've trudged out here to fish for a fuller version o' the tale, but I'm afraid that's all I've got to give you. And that travelin' merchant's moved on, and all."
54,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_KEITHA_000_14","You might have more luck with Armelle at the Mirror Planks. There's a good chance our peddler friend talked to her on his way through. Merchants tend to stop off there on their way out o' the South Shroud, see."
55,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_ARMELLE_000_21","Have I heard any tales of sylphs from passing merchants? My apologies, but I am usually far too busy haggling over their outrageous prices to inquire about the latest rumors and gossip."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_ARMELLE_000_22","If it is rumors you seek, may I suggest a visit to Buscarron's Druthers in the South Shroud?"
57,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_ARMELLE_000_23","The tavern's proprietor─that's <Emphasis>Buscarron</Emphasis>─misses little of the news making the rounds among his customers, and may well know much that I do not. As I'm sure you're aware, the South Shroud is south of here. Follow the road and you can't go wrong."
58,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_BUSCARRON_000_31","Well met, adventurer! We have the finest grog and grub this side of─ Eh? Not here to fill your belly, then?"
59,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_BUSCARRON_000_32","Ahhh, a hunger for news, is it? Aye, there's been talk of a sylph lurking hereabouts, but I couldn't rightly say if it be the elder you seek."
60,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_BUSCARRON_000_33","Those woodland scamps all look alike, you see. Short of painting one red and another one blue, most folk would struggle to tell two of 'em apart."
61,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_BUSCARRON_000_34","If you've the time, mayhap you could stay a while and see what the gods have in store. You never know, you might even stumble across this sylph elder yourself."
62,"TEXT_SUBFST092_00366_BUSCARRON_000_35","And it just so happens I could use an adventurer's expertise in a number of matters. You'll not want for work 'round here, I'll tell you that much!"
