3,"TEXT_SUBFST097_00371_SEQ_03","Rolandaix reveals that the items you uncovered were pieces of Gelmorran tableware, confirming his theory that the ruins are indeed what remains of Gelmorra's residential district. He goes on to express his fervent hope that the remnants of the city can one day be re-established as a settlement for the displaced Duskwight Elezen."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST097_00371_ROLANDIAX_000_2","I am all but convinced that we stand in what was once Gelmorra's residential district. Alas, I have yet to recover a sufficiency of domestic objects to confirm my theory. Should you happen upon any such items while wandering the area, I would be most grateful if you'd bring them to me."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST097_00371_ROLANDIAX_000_11","Back so soon? Are you quite certain you exercised the appropriate amount of care and delicacy in your search? These artifacts are hundreds of years─oh, never mind. Show me what you found."

...But I am rambling. Thank you for your help."
