1,"TEXT_SUBFST098_00372_SEQ_01","Irielle's supply of lantern oil is running low, and she wishes you to return to Buscarron's Druthers and ask the proprietor if he has any to spare. At the same time, she would have you present Buscarron with four ochu leaflets─a childishly simple task made more difficult by the fact that she doesn't have any. It seems you will need to pluck the leaves from the cold dead tendrils of the overgrown offerings in the area."
2,"TEXT_SUBFST098_00372_SEQ_02","You have plucked four leaflets from the overgrown offerings. Deliver the leaves and Irielle's request to Buscarron at the Druthers."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST098_00372_SEQ_03","It would seem that Irielle provides Buscarron with the ochu leaflets he uses to prepare the tavern's meals in exchange for a steady supply of lantern oil. Upon taking receipt of your freshly picked offerings, the tavern keeper pledges to have a flask of fuel delivered to Issom-Har forthwith. Though clearly relieved to learn of Irielle's preservation, Buscarron seems somewhat disappointed by her apparent preference for rocks over his hearty, home-cooked fare."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST098_00372_TALK_IRIELLE_000_2","Ah, and your request must be accompanied by a delivery of four ochu leaflets.
...I'm sorry? “Where are they?” Oh, just pluck them from the overgrown offerings you see scampering about. They won't feel a thing if you slay them first."

54,"TEXT_SUBFST098_00372_BUSCARRON_000_14","We have an arrangement, see: Irielle brings me the leaves I need, and I supply her with fuel for her lanterns. Must be quite a pile of rocks she's found to keep her from a hot meal at the Druthers. Still, at least I know she's not hurt."
