1,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_01","Brother E–Sumi has requested that you travel to the South Shroud and speak with Miriela at Buscarron's Druthers. As an acquaintance of Sylphie's, the tavern worker may be able to provide some insight into the young conjurer's present state of mind."
2,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_02","Your conversation with Miriela reveals much about Sylphie's past, but little about her present state. Seek the young conjurer at the east gate of the tavern grounds, and see if she will open up to you."
3,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_03","Sylphie reveals that she is still troubled by her mother's failure to teach her about the power of nature, and declares that she will not leave the South Shroud until she has found something to justify this oversight. She also mentions sensing the taint of corruption emanating from somewhere in the vicinity of Silent Arbor. Locate the disturbance and investigate its source."
4,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_04","You have vanquished the creature that emerged from the midst of the corruption. It seems to have left something in its wake..."
5,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_05","You recover what is left of a diary from the earth where the disturbance originated. Return to Buscarron's Druthers and show the book to Sylphie."
6,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_06","It would seem the diary you recovered belonged to Sylphie's late mother. Upon reading the entries contained therein, the young conjurer is convinced of the path that she must take. Return to Stillglade Fane and report to Brother E–Sumi."
7,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SEQ_07","Having learned of her mother's final wishes, Sylphie is now determined to embrace the power of nature. At long last, the young conjurer seems to have put her personal troubles behind her. The general mood of hope is dampened, however, by the revelation that the Twelveswood is suffering from some widespread and as yet unknown affliction. Return to your studies and seek greater mastery over your art in preparation for the day when Brother E–Sumi calls upon you once more.

※The next conjurer quest will be available from E–Sumi–Yan upon reaching level 30."

49,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_2","Glad I am that you have come, for I would ask your assistance in a matter of some delicacy. It concerns, yes, young Sylphie once again..."
50,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_3","As you can no doubt imagine, the recent revelations concerning her mother have sorely troubled the poor child. Thus, when she begged leave to visit her childhood home in the South Shroud, I was content to grant her request."
51,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_4","Unfortunately, she subsequently failed to return upon the date we had agreed... I can only assume that she requires more time with her thoughts."
52,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_5","Nor is this unexpected. Though Sylphie's talents overshadow those of many conjurers years her senior, the girl herself is scarcely more than a child. It cannot be an easy matter to sort through the whirlwind of emotions which now beset her."
53,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_6","I do not deem it wise, however, to disturb her unduly as she takes her first, halting steps on the path towards accepting nature. Thus, I would once again call upon your aid."
54,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_7","I ask that you speak with Miriela, a long-time acquaintance of Sylphie's, and learn how our young conjurer fares."
55,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_8","Miriela works at a tavern in the South Shroud called Buscarron's Druthers. A kindly soul, she will gladly tell you all you need to know...and a little more, no doubt. May the elementals watch over you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
56,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_21","Hello, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>petal<Else/>darlin'</If>! An' what can I do for you?"
57,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_22","Ohhh! Worried about our Sylphie, are you? I can't imagine what she's done to attract the attention of such worldly folk!"
58,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_23","Aye, well, she's certainly had a hard time of it, an' that's no lie. Lost her ma far too early in life, an' got bundled off to the city to live with them nature mages. Never did take to it too well, from what I hear."
59,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_24","An' then she comes thunderin' back down here after gods know how many moons, an' starts plyin' me with questions like she'd never been away. Had me head spinnin', she did."
60,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_25","I was good friends with her ma, you see. Nice lass, but just as odd as the daughter."
61,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_26","She had this knack for healin' folk, an' was always sayin' how she'd be glad to give her own life if it'd help save someone else's. Aye...a strong an' carin' woman was Sylphie's ma. Odd or not, you couldn't help but fall in love with her a little bit."
62,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_27","'Course, when the Calamity came down, there were plenty as needed healin'. So off she went into the thick of it...an' that was the last I ever saw of her."
63,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_28","The poor lass's dedication to healin' made quite an impression on young Sylphie, I reckon. 'Tis no surprise she chose to walk the same path."
64,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_29","Anyroad, Sylphie hasn't said much of herself since she came back, but I can see she's hurtin'. <sigh> Always tryin' to keep all the pain an' sufferin' to herself. Like mother, like daughter."
65,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_30","You a friend of hers, then? Well, might be as she'd open up to you if you give her half a chance."
66,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_31","It don't do no one no good to wallow in it for too long. Workin' where I do, I've seen plenty of folk try to drown their sorrows, but it only makes 'em deeper in the end. Trick is to catch 'em <Emphasis>early</Emphasis>."
67,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_MIRIELA_000_32","Take yourself over to the east gate. Our Sylphie should be wanderin' by any moment now."

69,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_42","Did Brother E–Sumi send you? I'm sorry, I...don't even know what day it is."
70,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_43","I used to live near here, you know, though my house is gone now."
71,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_44","I came back hoping to find something─<Emphasis>anything</Emphasis> that would help me understand why my mother never taught me about nature...and I can't leave until I have. I just can't."
72,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_45","But I promise I haven't forgotten about conjury. In fact, I sensed something just the other day─it felt like the corruption you cleansed during our lesson."
73,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_46","Do you think...maybe...you could have a look for me? It feels strongest in the area around Silent Arbor, east of here."
74,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_50","The corruption I sensed felt strongest near Silent Arbor, to the east of here. I'd look myself, but I don't think I'm strong enough to face a sprite like the ones you fought before."

76,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_62","Huh? Where did you─? That's my mother's diary!"
77,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_63","<gasp> There's an entry from the night of the Calamity..."
78,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_64","“I had thought the Calamity a distant threat. But the destruction it has wrought... Life ebbs and fades, no matter how much of my art I pour forth. How futile the efforts of mortals in the face of such devastation."
79,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_65","Yet in the midst of this suffering I have come to notice more than just the loss of life. I see people supported by earth, hearts soothed by wind, and wounds cleansed by water."
80,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_66","Thus I commit my prayer to these pages. I beg you, elements of the wood, teach my child that she need not walk alone─that there exists a greater force that enfolds us and lends us strength beyond measure...“"
81,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_67","..."
82,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_68","A force that enfolds us and lends us strength?"
83,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_69","And that part about the elements... She was talking about nature, wasn't she, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!? She wanted me to know!"
84,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_70","Thank you. I know now what I must do."
85,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_71","I'm ready to return to the guild. I think Brother E–Sumi has worried enough!"

88,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_82","Brother E–Sumi, I'm sorry I took so long..."
89,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_83","I understand, child. Did you find the answers you sought?"
90,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_84","Yes─thanks to <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> found my mother's diary, you see─right in the middle of an elemental disturbance."
91,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_85","My mother wrote about her experiences with nature, and how she wanted me to learn how to borrow its strength, and not be alone. It was...the last entry."

93,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_87","So it was her final wish that you embrace nature... How fitting that the elements should lead you to this revelation."
94,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_88","Tell me, Sylphie─has the fog of indecision now lifted from your mind?"
95,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_89","It has, Guildmaster."
96,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_90","Full glad am I to hear that, for I must ask of you one more question."
97,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_91","Yes, Brother E–Sumi?"
98,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_92","When you first witnessed <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> cleanse a corrupted element, you mentioned hearing voices. How exactly did they sound?"
99,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_93","The voices? Well...they sounded joyful, like a crowd letting out a sudden cheer. I really heard them, I swear!"
100,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_94","I am sure you did, Sylphie. This is a gift."
101,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_95","Conjurers may sense the power of nature, and borrow from its strength. But not all can hear its whispers."
102,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_96","What you describe are the voices of the elementals. You may very well possess the talent to become a Hearer."
103,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_SYLPHIE_000_97","A <Emphasis>Hearer</Emphasis>!?"
104,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_98","Of course, much relies on your studies of conjury. You have a natural aptitude, but have thus far lacked commitment. You must not neglect your training, Sylphie."
105,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_99","Putting aside such matters for a moment, I am curious to hear about the disturbance you observed in the South Shroud, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

106,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_100","Hmmm... This bodes ill. Ocher jellies are not native to the Twelveswood. I wonder what relation this may have to the seemingly ever-increasing frequency of these disturbances."
107,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_101","Something beyond the damage wrought by the Calamity afflicts the Twelveswood. I shall commune with the elementals and seek to identify this threat."
108,"TEXT_CLSCNJ005_00440_ESUMIYAN_000_102","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, Sylphie, I may have need of you both before long. Until then, give yourselves over to the study of our art."
