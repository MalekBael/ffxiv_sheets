9,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SEQ_09","At last, Sylphie has felt the embrace of nature and is ready to set forth upon the path of conjury alone. Observing that your experiences alongside the young conjurer have served to deepen your own understanding of the art, Brother E–Sumi rewards you with the potent healing spell Cure II. Though your tutelage under the guildmaster has come to an end, your journey as a conjurer continues ever onwards."

53,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_2","Expansive wounds that ooze corruption have formed throughout the forest. Though disturbances of this kind are wont to occur from time to time, they have hitherto done so in isolation. Never have I witnessed an incident of this magnitude.

57,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_6","Since I got back from the South Shroud, I've spent all my time studying the forces of nature! I even sat through one of Hearer Nolanel's lectures!"
58,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_7","I understand so much now. My skills are still a bit...lacking...in some areas, but I want to help protect the forest."
59,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_8","Lacking? Sylphie, you have yet to master a single offensive spell. Without the means to defend yourself, it would be far too dangerous to send you off into the forest alone."

65,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_14","And should you chance to encounter the origin of these disturbances, <Emphasis>do not</Emphasis> initiate a confrontation. Too often, you allow your curiosity to overwhelm your good sense. Now go, and may the elementals watch over you."

67,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_16","Something tells me we should start at Quarrymill in the South Shroud. Meet me there as soon as you can, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. And hurry─the corruption is spreading!"
68,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_21","There's the tainted soil, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Please do what you can."
69,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_22","That was brilliant, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! But it was only the start. The forest still groans in pain─I can hear it."

73,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_33","It's to the east, I think. Yes, to the east."
74,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_41","Right there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. This corruption is everywhere..."

76,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_43","There's another disturbance. And it's big. <Emphasis>Really</Emphasis> big. It's hard to describe, but it feels...sort of...<Emphasis>wrong–er</Emphasis>. I think... I think it might be what's causing all of this."
77,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_44","I know Brother E–Sumi said we weren't to confront it, but we can't just let it corrupt the rest of the forest.

81,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_63","Quite. I take it the two of you conspired to defy my orders?"
82,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_64","W-Well...the forest was suffering! We couldn't just walk away..."
83,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_65","It's not <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>'s fault! It's mine. It was all my idea. I take full responsibility!"
84,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_66","Calm yourself, child."
85,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_67","You did nothing I did not foresee. I am of no mind to lecture you."
86,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_68","Indeed, Gridania is indebted to you for your heroic deeds. The corruption born of Akoman had taken root in the Calamity-weakened soil─there is no telling how much further it might have spread if you had not defeated the creature."
87,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_69","And if I am not mistaken, Sylphie, you succeeded in drawing upon the energies of nature during the battle."
88,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_70","How did you─? Yes. Yes, I did. I'm not really sure how it happened. I remember thinking how badly I wanted to help <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, and then I suddenly felt the power surging through me."
89,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_71","That is as it should be. One does not simply <Emphasis>choose</Emphasis> to borrow from nature's strength. The mind may command only that which the heart permits. In your desperation to help your friend, you opened your heart to nature, and nature responded to your need."
90,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_72","Ah, but we must not forget your part in this, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It is clear to me that your journey with Sylphie has brought you still closer to the pinnacle of our art."
91,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_73","I believe you are ready for the last of my teachings. Thus it is with great pleasure that I pass on another of our guild's magicks─a more potent form of the Cure spell is now yours to command."
92,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_ESUMIYAN_000_74","I have no doubt that it will serve you well in your continuing endeavors. Wheresoever you go, nature will go with you, my friend. Ever shall the earth meet your footfall, and the wind guide your path."
93,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_0001","I don't think you need to be able to hear the voices of the forest to notice <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>, do you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
94,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_0002","The corruption is definitely coming from somewhere around here."
95,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_0003","Hmmm...that's odd. As soon as we arrived, that sense of wrongness I had suddenly felt less...well...it just felt <Emphasis>less</Emphasis>."
96,"TEXT_CLSCNJ006_00441_SYLPHIE_000_0004","It's almost as if it's holding its breath. Or hiding."
