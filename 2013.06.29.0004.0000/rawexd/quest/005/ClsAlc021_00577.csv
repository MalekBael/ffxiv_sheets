49,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_001","Let us see if we can continue this trend of unexpected success. For your first lesson, I want you to use your bronze alembic there and make me a bottle of distilled water."
50,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_002","Distilled water is simply the end result of purifying a murkier sample of life's most vital element. As such, it provides the perfect introduction to one of alchemy's most fundamental processes: taking a material and refining it into a purer form."
51,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_003","To perform this rudimentary exercise, you shall require a bottle of muddy water and a water shard. The impure water can be purchased from the supplier standing near the entrance to the guild. The name momentarily escapes me... Esmenet? Yes, that was it."
52,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_004","If it happens that you find this basic task beyond your abilities, then mayhap alchemy is not the discipline for you. Which would be quite upsetting, as I detest the thought of having to select a new...assistant. Try not to disappoint me."

54,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_010","Your task is to provide me with one bottle of distilled water. Come, come, we are wasting time. Purchase a bottle of muddy water from Esmenet, if you must."
55,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_020","Hm hm hm. Heh heh heh. Mwahahahahaha! Magnificent! Your transformation into an alchemist has begun!"
56,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_021","Do you understand the liquid treasure you have made? Yes, it is still simply water, but now possessed of almost limitless potential! In a properly distilled state, water provides the base ingredient for all manner of wondrous concoctions."
57,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_022","On the other hand, a potion created with impure water is not only unlikely to have the desired effect─it may very well poison the imbiber!"
58,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_023","Look well upon the substance you have refined. See how crystal clear it has become. Not the most flavorful of libations, but still refreshing to pour over one's head on a stifling summer afternoon!"
59,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_024","Tell me, how did you feel in the instant of its purification? Such a fine result must have sent thrills of excited satisfaction down your spine. Yes...I know well that sensation."
60,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_025","To glean a pristine drop from filthy swill─it is a miracle born of mortal artifice. Nothing can compare to that rush of triumph in the moment when physical laws bend to one's will! Nothing!"
61,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_026","The greater your mastery of alchemy, the more ecstatic that feeling becomes. Go, fill your chambers with bottles of distilled water and revel in each success!"
62,"TEXT_CLSALC021_00577_SEVERIAN_027","I return now to my experiments. When next you disturb me I shall expect your skills to be worthy of a guildmaster's chosen assistant."
