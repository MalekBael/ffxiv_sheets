Its members are always looking for capable indivduals to recruit to their cause, and it appears your recent exploits have drawn their attention. The Scions are headquartered in a place called the Waking Sands, situated at Vesper Bay in western Thanalan. Make your way there and present yourself to the guardsman."
2,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_SEQ_02","At the entrance to the Waking Sands, you find not a guardsman but a bubbly clerk named Tataru, who informs you that the Antecedent awaits within. Let Tataru know when you are ready to be shown through."

90,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100110_MINFILIA","We are the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, an order that transcends political boundaries. Our single objective is the preservation of the future of Eorzea."
91,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100120_MINFILIA","Among our gravest concerns are the god-like beings known as the primals."
92,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100130_MINFILIA","Their existence is a bane upon Eorzea─nay, the world at large, and we have striven to find a lasting solution to the threat they pose."
93,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100140_MINFILIA","Our order is home to a number of individuals who, like you, possess a rare and special talent."
94,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100150_MINFILIA","This talent takes various forms, but one holds particular interest for us."
95,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100160_MINFILIA","Tell me, have you ever experienced a sudden, inexplicable loss of consciousness?"
96,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100170_MINFILIA","Have you ever had the sensation of being pulled away from reality? Felt as though you were hovering in space, a mind without a body?"
97,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100180_MINFILIA","All these things are the manifestations of your talent. Yours is the power to transcend the boundaries of the soul─a power known as the Echo."
98,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100190_MINFILIA","The Echo allows you to pass through the walls of a man's soul, and hear the resonations of his past."
99,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100200_MINFILIA","You will be there in his memories, and see things as he saw them. You may even interact with that which you see, though you cannot change the outcome of events."
100,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100210_MINFILIA","For another blessing, the Echo will enable you to know a man's mind even if you cannot comprehend his words."
101,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100220_MINFILIA","In short, the Echo is a truly extraordinary power. And this power is strong within you."
102,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100230_MINFILIA","It is only a shame that we cannot use it whensoever we choose."
103,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100240_MINFILIA","That's right. I too possess the Echo."
104,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100250_MINFILIA","With that established, let us return to the subject of the primals."
105,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100260_MINFILIA","So long as they exist, the realm cannot take so much as a single step towards true peace."
106,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100270_MINFILIA","Measures must be taken─measures which transcend boundaries, be they of faction, race, language, or creed. And to do so, the Scions require the aid of those with our talent."
107,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100280_MINFILIA","Make no mistake─the Echo will be instrumental in dealing with the primal threat. Without it, we cannot hope to save the realm."
108,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100290_MINFILIA","I know not what it is you desire for yourself, nor what it was that first brought you to Eorzea."
109,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100300_MINFILIA","But I firmly believe that the power we possess was given to us for a purpose."
110,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100310_MINFILIA","Why else would the gods entrust man with a gift so extraordinary, if not to have him use it?"
111,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_100320_MINFILIA","And so I implore you: lend us your power."
112,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_50","Naturally, your aid will not go unrewarded. We have influential allies, you see, and at a word from me, you will be afforded special privileges that would otherwise be difficult to obtain."
113,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_51","For instance, are you familiar with retainers? They are the men and woman who manage your assets and belongings on your behalf."
114,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_TATARU_000_52","The papers you requested, my lady."

117,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_55","As a gesture of our welcome, I have taken the liberty of adding your name to the retainers' registry. As of now, you will be able to hire the services of a retainer."
118,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_56","You may learn the particulars of the service from the experts, but trust me when I say that retainers will prove invaluable in your adventuring endeavors."
119,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_57","So you see, we will do all in our power to facilitate your personal objectives."
120,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_58","In return, we ask that you aid us to the fullest extent of your talents."
121,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_59","A mutually beneficial relationship, I am sure you will agree, and one which serves the greater good besides."
122,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_60","Well, that was a veritable lecture, wasn't it? But now you know our purpose as well as what we have to offer. Please consider your answer, and let me know if we can expect your cooperation."
123,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_61","In good faith, I shall entrust you with our order's password, which our members use to reach one another when afield."
124,"TEXT_MANFST206_00509_MINFILIA_000_62","It is “wild rose.” Pray keep it safe."
