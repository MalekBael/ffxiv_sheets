50,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000030_ALISAIE","Brother, are you certain this course is best?"
51,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000040_ALPHINAUD","Whatever do you mean, dear sister?"
52,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000050_ALISAIE","The so-called “Remembrance” ceremonies were little more than standard-waving rallies."
53,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000060_ALISAIE","...As though the Calamity and Seventh Umbral Era warranted scarcely a mention!"
54,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000070_ALPHINAUD","Well, of course they were “standard-waving rallies.”"
55,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000080_ALPHINAUD","Since you are so observant, mayhap you noticed what mention was made of the Warriors of Light? <Emphasis>None</Emphasis>."
56,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000090_ALPHINAUD","I suppose they must have forgotten the heroes who spared Eorzea a fate worse than the Calamity?"
57,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000100_ALPHINAUD","No, dear Alisaie, they haven't “forgotten” these details. They have elected to “omit” them."
58,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000110_ALPHINAUD","Deep are the wounds the Calamity inflicted upon Eorzea. So deep, in fact, that the realm still bleeds."
59,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000120_ALPHINAUD","Needless to say, the beast tribes and their primals do little to alleviate the pain."
60,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000130_ALPHINAUD","So the task of salving Eorzea's wounds falls to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn─with a little help from our friends the Grand Companies."
61,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000140_ALPHINAUD","Remembrance will yield no remedy. If our world is to heal, we must put the horrors of the Calamity behind us."
62,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000150_ALISAIE","Our grandfather would never entrust the fate of the realm to despots who rewrite history to their convenience."
63,"TEXT_MANFST301_00512_000160_ALISAIE","There must be another way to cure what ails this world─and I mean to find it!"
