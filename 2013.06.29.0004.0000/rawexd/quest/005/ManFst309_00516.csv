49,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000020_YSHTOLA","Concerning the kobolds they sent such copious notes on, I presume?"
50,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000030_MINFILIA","Yes, and no. It has more to do with their findings, which portend a peril far greater than any beast tribe."
51,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000040_YSHTOLA","What sort of peril?"
52,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000050_MINFILIA","The worst kind. A tribe of Kobolds in the vicinity of Limsa Lominsa has reawakened Titan."
53,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000060_MINFILIA","Our task will be to slay the primal. The Maelstrom have sworn support for the endeavor."
54,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000070_MINFILIA","They are no strangers to the havoc kobolds can wreak."
55,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000080_YSHTOLA","Years before the Grand Company's reformation, two primals, Leviathan and Titan, chanced to converge upon the seawall, wreaking untold devastation."
56,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000090_YSHTOLA","There but for the grace of the Navigator were the mercenaries Merlwyb hired able to fend them off."
57,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000100_YSHTOLA","Yet it did not take long for the beast tribes to regroup, and they summoned their primals once more."
58,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000110_MINFILIA","Thankfully, their second coming was decidedly short-lived─but that is beside the point."
59,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000120_MINFILIA","So long as tormented souls will them to exist, the realm will never be rid of primals."
60,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000130_YSHTOLA","The Maelstrom has kept a watchful eye upon the beast tribes─and the kobolds in particular─ever since."
61,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000140_YSHTOLA","Which brings us to the matter at hand."
62,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000150_MINFILIA","Unlike Ifrit, we know scarcely anything of Titan."
63,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000160_MINFILIA","Unfortunately, the only force known to have bested him─the modestly named “Company of Heroes”─disbanded five years since, and mercenaries are not in the habit of keeping chronicles."
64,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000170_YSHTOLA","Expect the worst."
65,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000180_YSHTOLA","The Maelstrom's help is of course appreciated, but even if we had their whole armada at our disposal, we could still find ourselves overmatched."

68,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000210_YSHTOLA","No one would think you a coward were you to decline."
69,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000220_MINFILIA","So you will accept?"
70,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000230_MINFILIA","Thank you."
71,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000240_THANCRED","We can't very well send <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> to Limsa Lominsa without Y'shtola, can we, Minfilia?"
72,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000250_MINFILIA","May I ask that of you, Y'shtola?"
73,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000260_YSHTOLA","I never thought it in question."
74,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000270_MINFILIA","Ever reliable."
75,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000280_MINFILIA","Very well. We will spare no effort to win victory."
76,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000290_MINFILIA","You may count on the full support of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn."
77,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000300_MINFILIA","And all not afield will aid the fight from afar."
78,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000310_MINFILIA","Thancred, Yda, go to the Grand Companies. Tell them of our plight and solicit their support."
79,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000320_MINFILIA","[MacroError]"
80,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000330_MINFILIA","Papalymo, compile all the information we have on Titan, little though it may be."
81,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000340_MINFILIA","You'll be apprised of the tactical situation when you reach the Sailor's Ward."
82,"TEXT_MANFST309_00516_000350_MINFILIA","Provision yourself for the journey. May you walk in the light of the Crystal."
