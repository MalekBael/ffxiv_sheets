2,"TEXT_MANSEA009_00545_SEQ_02","At the banquet, Merlwyb tells you of the Warriors of Light─the adventurers who fought for the survival of Eorzea five years ago. The tale of these brave souls triggers inside your mind a vision of their final stand at the Battle of Carteneau. When you subsequently come to your senses, you are surprised to find yourself in a room at the Drowning Wench, with no idea how you got there. Near at hand, Baderon explains that you collapsed, and mentions that the Admiral would like to see you. Make your way to Bulwark Hall, and request admission to the command room."
