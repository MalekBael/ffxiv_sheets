1,"TEXT_MANFST203_00675_SEQ_01","Baderon and Commodore Reyner have requested your assistance with an investigation. A strange ship has been sighted off the coast of Aleport, and the subsequent appearance of a dangerous-looking group of men at Sastasha Seagrot has the Yellowjackets greatly concerned. Speak with V'mellba at the ferry docks on the lower decks, and receive directions to the location of the caves."

3,"TEXT_MANFST203_00675_SEQ_03","After receiving reports describing the unsavory-looking men seen entering Sastasha, the Yellowjackets have been on the lookout for the Sahagin and their pirate allies, the Serpent Reavers. Enter the caves and discover if the Yellowjackets' concerns are well grounded."

Just as the Yellowjackets had feared, it appears the Sahagin and the Serpent Reavers are using the caves as a base for their nefarious operations. Return to Limsa Lominsa, and report to Baderon at the Drowning Wench."

60,"TEXT_MANFST203_00675_REYNER_000_17","But with recent developments, it would appear a follow-up investigation is in order."
61,"TEXT_MANFST203_00675_REYNER_000_18","The Sahagin test our defenses daily, and, though it may seem overly cautious, I am loath to spread our forces too thin by pulling another squad from their duties."

75,"TEXT_MANFST203_00675_YELLOWJACKET_000_36","So, adventurer. Your task is to poke around in the caves, and find out just exactly who we're dealing with. I'll be here, praying to the gods you don't spot any blue face tattoos."

83,"TEXT_MANFST203_00675_PAIYOREIYO_000_56","I never expected our first visit to the Adventurers' Guild to yield such a simple chance for fame and fortune."
