1,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_01","It would seem that a cult known as the Lambs of Dalamud has been engaging in suspicious activity in the Tam–Tara Deepcroft. Make your way to the burial site and speak with the Quiverman posted by the entrance to receive further instructions."
2,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_02","You learn that the Lambs of Dalamud believe in the divinity of the lesser moon, Dalamud, whose descent ushered in the Seventh Umbral Era. Your task is to sweep the Deepcroft and purge it of cultist presence."
3,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_03","Arriving at the innermost depths of the Tam–Tara Deepcroft, you are assailed by the vengeful spirit of Galvanth the Dominator. At the end of a titanic struggle, you succeed in sending this dark being back to the abyss, thus foiling the cultists' plot to awaken a great evil. Make haste back to Gridania, and report all that transpired to Miounne."
4,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_SEQ_04","Miounne laments the recent rise in casualties among adventurers. She attributes this unfortunate trend to a burgeoning demand for manpower, which makes it easier for the unprepared to take on tasks that are beyond them. Confident that you will give her no cause to worry, Miounne gladly tells you that the Adventurers' Guild in Ul'dah is recruiting. Speak with her again if you would know more."

51,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_7","Well, if it isn't our very own <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>! You certainly have a knack for appearing when you're most needed. My thanks for answering the call, friend."

53,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_9","Now, time is of the essence, so I shall proceed to the heart of the matter. We wish for you to nip a potential threat to Gridania whilst it is still in the bud."
54,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_10","Beneath the Central Shroud, there lies an underground burial site called the Tam–Tara Deepcroft."
55,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_11","The place was built long ago by the Gelmorrans, though we Gridanians have continued to make use of it to inter our dead."
56,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_12","Of late, however, shadowy figures are being sighted skulking about the Deepcroft, and with ever increasing regularity."
57,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_13","From what we've been able to glean, it would appear that these figures are members of the Lambs of Dalamud, a doomsday cult that appeared prior to the Calamity."

59,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_15","Ordinarily, I would have dispatched my best men to scour the Deepcroft and flush out the uninvited guests."
60,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_16","Alas, the Calamity did a number on our ranks, and what few hands I have left are constantly bound by the accursed Ixal."
61,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_17","The incident at the Guardian Tree seems to have ruffled their feathers, and the birdmen have grown even more restless than before. As a result, our forces are stretched thin in an effort to maintain security in the wood."
62,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_18","The situation so being, we must turn to others to deal with the Lambs of Dalamud. Can we rely on you to undertake this task, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
63,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LEWIN_000_19","The birdmen have grown restless of late, and I fear that a storm may be brewing. As a result, our forces are stretched thin in an effort to maintain security in the wood."

69,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_31","No doubt the Bowlord has already informed you, but your task is to enter the Deepcroft and purge it of the Lambs of Dalamud."
70,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_32","In case you are unfamiliar, the cult emerged shortly before the Calamity put an end to the Sixth Astral Era."
71,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_33","The cultists took the lesser moon, Dalamud, for their god, believing that it would deliver them from the devastation."
72,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_34","And so they were rather disappointed when Dalamud burst into a thousand pieces before it could complete its descent."
73,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_35","Having seen their god go up in flames, one would think that the cultists would become disillusioned with their faith. On the contrary, it served only to stoke the fires of their fanaticism."
74,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_36","The Lambs of Dalamud are convinced that heretics─that's to say, everyone else but them─interfered with the coming of their lord and savior, and now they seek to avenge him."
75,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_37","Whatever it is they are doing in the Deepcroft, it can lead to no good end. For the sake of all gods-fearing folk, please put an end to their vile ambitions."

79,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_KIKINA_000_50","Stay focused on our goal, sister! One day our adventures will be made into song, and it will all be worth it!"
80,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ISILDAURE_000_55","<huff> <puff> In my eagerness to sate my curiosity, I committed a novice mistake."
81,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ISILDAURE_000_56","Were it not for the fruit that Alianne found, my adventures may well have ended in this forbidding place."
82,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ISILDAURE_000_57","Always look before you leap... In my haste, this most fundamental wisdom had fled my mind. I do believe I shall rest here awhile."
83,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ALIANNE_000_60","I shudder to think what might have happened to Isildaure had I not thought to pick the fruit I found on the way here."
84,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ALIANNE_000_61","Sometimes he has too much vigor for his own good. Age is supposed to mellow us, but it has made him a rash man."
85,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_ALIANNE_000_62","I understand his desire to make his remaining days count, but just one misstep, and there will be <Emphasis>no</Emphasis> days left to count."
86,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_65","The Lambs of Dalamud are hells-bent on avenging their unholy lord, and will stop at nothing until their dark work is done."
87,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_GODSQUIVERBOW_000_66","We cannot brook their desecration of the Deepcroft any longer. For the sake of the souls laid to rest here, and indeed all of Gridania, put an end to their vile ambitions."
88,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_70","Welcome back, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! I'm pleased to hear that your foray into the Deepcroft was a success."
89,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_71","Of course, knowing what a capable adventurer you are, I wasn't expecting any other outcome. Nonetheless, you ought to be commended."
90,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_72","Of course, seeing as you came with Baderon's endorsement, I wasn't expecting any other outcome. Nonetheless, you ought to be commended."
91,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_73","Bowlord Lewin couldn't be here personally, but he also sends his thanks."
92,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_74","I must say, it's truly a relief to have a capable adventurer like you on hand."
93,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_75","You see, the number of casualties among adventurers has been on the rise of late. Times being as they are, the guild receives veritable mountains of petitions, and we struggle to find enough hands to handle them all."
94,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_76","While this means no shortage of work for adventurers, it also makes it easier for the unprepared to bite off more than they can chew. Lo, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. "
95,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LIAVINNE_000_77","Avere's gone, and it's all your fault! If it hadn't taken you an age to heal him, he would still be alive!"
96,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_EDDA_000_78","<sniff> B-But I tried! He bolted out of spell range before I could lift a finger!"
97,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_EDDA_000_79","<sob> He shouldn't have been so hard-pressed in the first place... We should've done more to lighten his burden..."

99,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LIAVINNE_000_81","I'm leaving as well. I doubt this comes as any surprise, but I <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> liked you. I only suffered you for your healing, but you couldn't even do that one thing right. Cruel though this may sound, you brought your loss upon yourself."
100,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_LIAVINNE_000_82","Oh, and by way of parting advice...get rid of Avere's head! Bury it, cremate it─do whatever the hells you like with it, but for gods' sakes, stop carrying it around! It's...it's all sorts of <Emphasis>wrong</Emphasis>!"

104,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_86","Now you see why I'm grateful for an adventurer such as you. I can trust you to head out on a mission without worrying─well, at least not so much─that you might not return."
105,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_87","And speaking of missions, I would entrust you with another."
106,"TEXT_MANFST204_00677_MIOUNNE_000_88","About a bell ago, I received word from the Adventurers' Guild in Ul'dah. They seek the services of a reliable adventurer, and you happen to be one of the most reliable I know."
