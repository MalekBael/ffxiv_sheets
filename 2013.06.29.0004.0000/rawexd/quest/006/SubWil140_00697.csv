49,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_LAMBERT_000_1","Tucked away in a corner of eastern Thanalan lies Halatali, and it is there that you will find all the excitement you crave!"
50,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_LAMBERT_000_2","The place boasts a storied history. It was built some one hundred years past as a training ground for gladiators. The Calamity laid ruin to it, though, as it did to most things. Now, Halatali is a shadow of its former self."
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_LAMBERT_000_3","But in the dark of that shadow lurk wild beasts, both bloodthirsty and beyond count. For one such as yourself─one so brave as to challenge the primals themselves─I daresay there is no place finer than Halatali to test your skill and refine your technique."
52,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_LAMBERT_000_4","Indeed, I've taken the liberty of passing your name along to the Brass Blades who oversee the place. Should you visit, speak with one Fafajoni near the entryway."
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_LAMBERT_000_5","It's not often I vouch for an adventurer, so don't go getting yourself killed and besmirching my good name, now, hear? Heh heh heh!"

55,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_FAFAJONI_000_11","Permit me to tell you something of this place. The name comes from an ancient tongue, Halatali meaning “the land of many shadows.” It was here that our distant ancestors first settled, and─
Bah, you have not come all this way for a lesson in history."
56,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_FAFAJONI_000_12","Shhh, listen. Do you not hear the howls and growls? Do you not feel how they shake the very earth beneath you?"
57,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_FAFAJONI_000_13","That is the work of no wind, my friend. Those are the calls of Halatali, for now the beasts once kept for the Coliseum lurk here."
58,"TEXT_SUBWIL140_00697_FAFAJONI_000_14","And these are no gentle beasts broken by the hand of man. No, there are those within that even the might of the Brass Blades cannot tame."
