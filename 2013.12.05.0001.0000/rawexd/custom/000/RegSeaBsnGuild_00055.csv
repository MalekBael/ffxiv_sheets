1,"TEXT_REGSEABSNGUILD_00055_BRITHAEL_000_2","Oh, not much. I'm jus' forgemaster o' this here guild. I ain't one to stand on ceremony, though, so ye can jus' call me Brithael."
2,"TEXT_REGSEABSNGUILD_00055_BRITHAEL_000_3","As fer what ol' Brithael does... Well, what I <Emphasis>enjoy</Emphasis> doin' is lookin' after the new recruits, trainin' 'em an' whatnot."
3,"TEXT_REGSEABSNGUILD_00055_BRITHAEL_000_4","'Course, as an employee o' Naldiq & Vymelli's, I've got a whole mess of other duties besides. Fer instance, makin' sure contracts get fulfilled an' securin' new ones."
4,"TEXT_REGSEABSNGUILD_00055_BRITHAEL_000_5","Fortunately, Forgemaster H'naanza o' the Armorers' Guild usually handles that shite. Else I wouldn't have time to keep me thirst at bay."

7,"TEXT_REGSEABSNGUILD_00055_BRITHAEL_000_8","Well, maybe not sharp sticks. Anyway, to craft all that, ye need to know how to work all manner o' metals. Some folk think a strong arm's all it takes, but that ain't the half of it."
8,"TEXT_REGSEABSNGUILD_00055_BRITHAEL_000_9","Ye won't go far without the knowledge an' technique essential to the craft. That, plus hard work an' dedication─aye, all that's key to blacksmithin'."
