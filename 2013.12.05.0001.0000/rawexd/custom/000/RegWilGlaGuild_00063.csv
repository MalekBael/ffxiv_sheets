6,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_010","Well, I don't just stand around gawping, if that's what you're asking. I am Mylla, guildmaster here."
7,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_011","I instruct these would-be warriors on the finer points of swordsmanship. If you like, I could teach you a thing or two as well, though I can't promise to be gentle."
