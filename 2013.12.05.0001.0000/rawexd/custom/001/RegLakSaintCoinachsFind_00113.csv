11,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_020","You stand amidst the ruins of ancient Allag, an empire which reached its zenith during the Third Astral Era, some five millennia ago."
12,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_021","The excavation effort is presided over by the Sons of Saint Coinach, a Sharlayan order. Lest you wonder, we name ourselves for the man who was raised to sainthood for proving the existence of the Allagan Empire, which was long thought to be naught but the stuff of myths."
13,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_022","From the crystalline tower that threatens to pierce the very heavens to the immense ruins that stretch in all directions below, there is no shortage of new discoveries here."

15,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_031","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>The Allagan Empire has left behind many a mysterious legacy, but perhaps none so impressive as the glittering spire of the Crystal Tower. With equal parts excitement and trepidation, the survey party dubbed “Team Noah” set forth to pry loose the daunting structure's well-guarded secrets.</Emphasis>"
16,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_032","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>Once past the massive crystal gate, the members of the team beheld four pairs of grim stone statues flanking a broad forecourt─a lethal complement of elementally powered defenses known as the Eight Sentinels.</Emphasis>"
17,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_033","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>Each pair of silent sentries promised a different method of obliteration to any foolish enough to attempt trespass. Should intruders somehow survive passing through the first barrier of incinerating flames, they would then face death by rending winds, crushing waves, or grinding rocks.</Emphasis>"
18,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_034","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>These unforgiving guardians were, without a doubt, a product of the unique blend of magic and technology pioneered by the great inventors of Allag.</Emphasis>"
19,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_035","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>To think that these constructs of arcane masonry yet functioned after millennia of dormancy is simply staggering─a testament to the genius of their creators.</Emphasis>"
20,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_036","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>But we would not be deterred from our objectives. Using four reflective “fangs” shaped from flawless crystals, we triumphed in turning the power of the elemental defenses against themselves. With the way thus cleared, the expedition stood poised to enter the inner reaches of the tower grounds.</Emphasis>"

24,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_043","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>As we had feared, the halls of the labyrinth were further protected by fantastical foes. Our adventurers faced nightmarish opponents, the king behemoth and the voidsent Thanatos among them.</Emphasis>"
25,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_044","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>Through our research we have learned that the ancients were most skilled at the binding of void-born entities─occult servants that were compelled to serve alongside augmented beasts and chimerical monstrosities.</Emphasis>"

29,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_052","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>The empire lasted more than a thousand years, but that is not to say its reign was entirely peaceful.

30,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_053","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>Famous even among these endless conflicts was the rebellion led by the mighty general Acheron.

31,"TEXT_REGLAKSAINTCOINACHSFIND_00113_RAMMBROES_000_054","(-NOAH Report-)<Emphasis>Adored though he was, the revolutionary leader was eventually captured by agents of the empire. Scholarly records give a chilling account of how his body was forcibly altered through sorcery and science, his mind broken and conditioned to obey.</Emphasis>"
