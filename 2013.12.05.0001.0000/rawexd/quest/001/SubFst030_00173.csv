50,"TEXT_SUBFST030_00173_VIONNE_000_3","My colleague Gillian will furnish you with the item in question, and provide all the necessary directions. She should be somewhere behind the stables, supervising the fieldhands."

59,"TEXT_SUBFST030_00173_VIONNE_000_31","Oh, my! Did I neglect to inform you of the sack's contents? I cannot apologize enough!"
60,"TEXT_SUBFST030_00173_VIONNE_000_32","That would certainly explain why you agreed to help when countless others turned their noses up at the idea, so to speak...
Well, what's done is done. Please accept this for your troubles, along with my thanks."
