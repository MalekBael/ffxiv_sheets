66,"TEXT_SUBWIL007_00167_JULIANA_020","You've returned! Well, how did you fare?
...Two potential recruits, you say? Welcome news! I only hope their zeal for fashion will show in their efforts for the guild."
67,"TEXT_SUBWIL007_00167_JULIANA_021","What we do here may seem all silk and satin, to be sure, but the work within these walls is far from easy. In that, I suppose our trade is not unlike any other."
