49,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_1","Wonderful! Then you must speak to Guildmaster Lyngsath at once!"
50,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_2","This will come as no surprise, but he is the finest chef in Limsa Lominsa. His skill and dedication are second to none."
51,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_3","You will find the guildmaster up the stairs yonder, keeping a watchful eye on his charges. Impress upon him your desire to learn, and he will surely find a place for you in his stew─by which I mean the guild."
52,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_5","Still unsure? Then I think it best that you do not go before the guildmaster."
53,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_CHARLYS_000_6","As I believe I mentioned, he is passionate about cookery, and has little patience for those who show anything less than absolute commitment to the craft. Such ingredients spoil the stew, you see...and he is <Emphasis>fiercely</Emphasis> protective of his stew."
54,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_11","Well met, 'venturer. I take it ye want to join our guild. Let's 'ave a good look at ye, then."
55,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_12","...Bah! What's an underfed whelp like you know about cookin'? Judgin' by them scrawny arms o' yours, ye'd struggle to lift a spoon, never mind a skillet!"
56,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_13","...Hahaha! I jest, I jest... <sigh> It don't take muscle to be a culinarian. 'Ells, it don't even take talent─'least not on its own."
57,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_14","No, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>son</If>, more'n anythin' else, becomin' a good cook boils down to <Emphasis>passion</Emphasis>. If ye got that, there ain't nothin' ye can't achieve. So tell me...'ave ye got it?"
58,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_Q1_000_1","Have you the passion to become a culinarian?"
59,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_A1_000_1","Yes"
60,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_A1_000_2","No"
61,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_15","Well, then...assumin' you ain't got an overwhelmin' urge to scrub me pans neither, I suggest ye bugger off back to where the food's served, an' leave the makin' of it to folks as give a damn."
62,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_21","That's the spirit! Aye, yer passion fer the culinary arts is plain to see."
63,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_22","An' ye'll be needin' every bit of it if ye want to become a master culinarian. Why, if mastery was a twelve-course dinner, I'd 'ardly 'ave finished the soup."
64,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_23","Make no mistake, our trade's as tough as old mutton, an' passion's the only thing what gets us through the gristly bits. But enough talk─what do ye call yerself?"
65,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_24","Well then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, welcome to the guild. To mark the occasion, I present ye with yer very own skillet."
66,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_25","Ain't much to look at, but it'll more'n serve a novice like yerself."
67,"TEXT_CLSCUL011_00271_LYNGSATH_000_26","Now then, let's see whether ye can tell which end's which. Aye, aye...I know I said ye'd struggle to lift a spoon, but ye've won me over. Now, show me ye <Emphasis>can</Emphasis> 'old a skillet, an' I'll get ye started on yer first task."
