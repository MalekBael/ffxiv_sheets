53,"TEXT_CLSCUL451_00269_LATISHA_000_012","To this end, you are to prepare a serving of Dzemael gratin.

Suffice it to say that only the finest sample of the dish, made with only the finest ingredients, will do on this occasion."

58,"TEXT_CLSCUL451_00269_LATISHA_000_014","As for the popoto slices, they are boiled enough to be cooked through, yet not so much as to render them bereft of texture. In summary, your Dzemael gratin leaves naught to be desired."
