3,"TEXT_SUBFST069_00385_SEQ_03","You have delivered the fishing rod to Berthe. The Elezen seems well acquainted with the normal denizens of the area, but has never before seen the likes of that strange, ghostly flame. Though thrilled to have her property returned, she wonders if she will ever attempt to fish at Lilystone again."
