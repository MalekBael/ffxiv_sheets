He has yet to test its effectiveness, though, and bids you offer the tonic to Landebert, a leader amongst the Ala Mhigan refugees living in Pearl Lane."
2,"TEXT_SUBWIL021_00394_SEQ_02","Landebert is well aware of Alewyn's true motives. However, despite the danger in relying on untested alchemical concoctions, the refugees have no choice but to accept Alewyn's so-called goodwill."
