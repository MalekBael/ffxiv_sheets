48,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_TMOKKRI_000_1","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Baderon has been most effusive in his praise of your accomplishments. Have you considered putting your abilities to use for the Adventurers' Guild by undertaking a guildleve or two?"
49,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_TMOKKRI_000_2","Guildleves are the means by which we document requests for assistance from the citizenry, prior to assigning them to adventurers possessed of the necessary skills."
50,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_TMOKKRI_000_3","From “battlecraft leves” that require the extermination of monsters, to “tradecraft leves” that ask for the creation of goods, the tasks we term “levequests” are many and varied in their nature."
51,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_TMOKKRI_000_4","Should your interest be piqued, I suggest you make your way to Swiftperch and speak with Swygskyf. He will be happy to set your feet on the path to completing your first levequest."

56,"TEXT_SUBSEA901_00693_SWYGSKYF_000_14","Good to hear. Now, megalocrabs, they like to run off to their mates when they're feelin' overmatched. If ye don't want to find yerself armpits-deep in snippers, then ye'd best finish 'em quickly."
