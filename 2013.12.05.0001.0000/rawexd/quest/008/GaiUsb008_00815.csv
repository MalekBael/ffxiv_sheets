1,"TEXT_GAIUSB008_00815_SEQ_01","Satisfied that you will not share his secret past with anyone, Landenel tells you that to even approach the adamantoise breeding grounds, you must first deal with the Wood Wailer sentries. Landenel muses aloud that if agaric flies were spotted feasting on the brownie brushes in the Lower Paths, he would be forced to send his sentries to guard the crop. He surreptitiously hands you a bottle of stingbrew, which you can use to weaken the flies should you encounter them."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB008_00815_SEQ_02","As Landenel feared, agaric flies have already taken notice of the brownie brushes. Having slain a swarm of the vilekin, collect a brownie brush as evidence."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB008_00815_SEQ_03","You harvest a single succulent brownie brush. Deliver it to Landenel and tell him of the agaric fly infestation."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB008_00815_SEQ_04","Landenel is unsurprisingly horrified to hear that you encountered agaric flies in the Lower Paths. All that remains is to inform his sentries..."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSB008_00815_LANDENEL_000_007","Aye, we will also soon need barrels of stingbrew to weaken and ward off the pests."
