1,"TEXT_GAIUSB103_00822_SEQ_01","The ingredient you seek is the meat of a Wellwick worm. The creatures are exceedingly rare and must be lured out before they can be slain. To this end, U'odh Nunh suggests you slay an angler and use its carcass as bait."

5,"TEXT_GAIUSB103_00822_SEQ_05","U'odh Nunh must first prepare the meat, but he promises to send it to Wheiskaet in time for the banquet. Because he does not know the location of the third ingredient, you must return to Costa del Sol and speak with the former captain for more information. However, before you can depart, U'odh Nunh has one final favor to ask."
