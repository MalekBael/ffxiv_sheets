1,"TEXT_GAIUSB110_00829_SEQ_01","U'tykha Tia informs you that he has the novice ranger U'kahzuna out practicing her skills on roving Amalj'aa in the east of the Sagolii Desert. As previously, he seems aware that she yet needs a push in order for her to reach her potential. Sensing that a teachable moment is nigh, he bids you seek U'kahzuna in the Sagolii Desert, and then defeat three Amalj'aa with her as witness."

He is worried that, without further intervention, the young ranger may cease her attempts to better herself."
