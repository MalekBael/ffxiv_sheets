2,"TEXT_GAIUSB707_00902_SEQ_02","All the dark braziers are now aglow, and grateful men will soon warm their frozen hands and read their letters from home. Report to Ser Arthurioux."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB707_00902_SEQ_03","Ser Arthurioux is pleased to hear that, for the first windy night in some time, every brazier at Camp Dragonhead is lit. He may find his duty a dull one, but you have a sneaking suspicion that he is well content to drowse by the fire."
