1,"TEXT_GAIUSB814_00923_SEQ_01","With Amajina & Sons now aware of the coblyns in their closet, Syntgoht will finally be able to fulfill his orders. His relief is palpable and his penitence potent. Start the last leg of your journey and deliver the cherry brandewine to Edwyn."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB814_00923_SEQ_02","The convoluted tale of ceruleum shortage is well received by Edwyn, especially when you pass on the cherry brandewine along with Syntgoht's apology. Words are wind, but a costly bottle of nectar sets a great deal to rights."
