1,"TEXT_GAIUSB902_00925_SEQ_01","Ser Benedict has pointed out that it would be reckless for Lord Drillemont to accept your claims without question. The knight believes that, at the very least, you should perform a few menial tasks on behalf of House Durendaire, like slaying feral crocs. A simple gesture like that will likely earn you the favor of Ser Clotairion, he adds. Take Ser Benedict's advice to heart and do as he suggests."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB902_00925_SEQ_02","One might be inclined to tell you that those crocs fought the good fight. That they gave you a memorable challenge, one that you would proudly share with comrades over a tankard of ale. But Eorzea is no faerie-tale world, and life is not a song. Sometimes you slay a primal, sometimes not. But perhaps Ser Clotairion will have a greater appreciation for your accomplishments."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB902_00925_SEQ_03","Ser Clotairion is grateful for your service, though he realizes full well that your intent was only to ingratiate yourself with him. Nevertheless, he promises that Lord Drillemont will know of your deeds."

It is his responsibility to ensure that Whitebrim Front is prepared for every eventuality, be it an endless blizzard or a Dravanian assault. He will not put our efforts to retake the Stone Vigil at risk without good cause, which you have yet to give."
