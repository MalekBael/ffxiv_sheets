1,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_01","As Minfilia begins to explain the importance of securing the Adventurers' Guild's cooperation, Alphinaud returns to the solar with one of the guild's emissaries, offering to handle negotiations in her stead. Thinking next to dispatch you to Revenant's Toll, Minfilia relents, and instead asks you to speak with her mother, sensing that something weighs heavily on her mind."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_02","The cause of F'lhaminn sudden sadness appears to be a damaged earring. She asks you to take the earring to the Goldsmiths' Guild in Ul'dah for repair, as she cannot bring herself to set foot there for reasons she refuses to explain. Journey to Ul'dah in her stead and seek the services of a guild goldsmith."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_03","The goldsmith you approach, Memedesu, recognizes the earrings as F'lhaminn's Aria, a famous design created by the master goldsmith Niellefrense. Honored to be entrusted with the legendary piece, he refuses payment─only asking that you attend to a small errand in his stead so that he may focus on the earrings. Travel to Byregot's Strike in southern Thanalan and collect a shipment of ores from Memedesu's supplier, Odinel."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_04","A surprised Odinel is more than happy to give you the ores, as Memedesu usually insists on conducting time-consuming inspections. Deliver the shipment to Memedesu at the Goldsmiths' Guild and see if the earrings are ready."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_05","Memedesu accepts the ores with a cursory glance, before assuring you that he took every precaution when handling F'lhaminn's Aria. Deliver the restored earrings to F'lhaminn at the Waking Sands."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_06","F'lhaminn grows somber at the sight of the earrings, and speaks of the man who gave them to her many years ago. Murdered with a magicked blade, his body refuses to decay, and to this day she still prays that his soul finds peace in Thal's realm. Regaining her composure, she insists that she is fine, and that you and Minfilia should concentrate on more important matters. Enter the solar and inform Minfilia of all that has transpired."
7,"TEXT_GAIUSE105_01179_SEQ_07","With all Scions assembled in the solar, Alphinaud announces that negotiations with the Adventurers' Guild have concluded, and that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn shall have a new home in Revenant's Toll: the Rising Stones. Minfilia then adds that the Alliance leaders have all agreed to support the Scion's plans, and that furthermore, she intends to discard the organization's remaining vestiges of secrecy and reveal its existence to all of Eorzea. Though these plans entail many risks, she is confident that, as always, the Scions will rise to the challenge, united, and overcome."
