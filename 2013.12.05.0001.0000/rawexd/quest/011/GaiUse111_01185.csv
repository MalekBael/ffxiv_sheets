1,"TEXT_GAIUSE111_01185_SEQ_01","The guildhests have gained some adherents in Revenant's Toll, but Slafborn worries that one disastrous mission will undo all that you have accomplished together. Join a particularly dangerous guildhest involving the noxious morbol, and bring it to a successful conclusion.

*The guildhest “More Than a Feeler” can be accessed via the Duty Finder."

3,"TEXT_GAIUSE111_01185_SEQ_03","Thanks to your fellow adventurers' fondness for ale and gossip, the dispatching of the morbol is already being talked about as the finest thing ever. Slafborn declares the Guild's morale to be unwaveringly high, before slyly reminding you that this too is a kind of sorcery."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSE111_01185_SLAFBORN_000_001","Heh, but of course one good turn leads to another… we hope. There's a 'hest that might be too much for adventurers already signed on to it. Your presence could mean the difference between life and death. "
