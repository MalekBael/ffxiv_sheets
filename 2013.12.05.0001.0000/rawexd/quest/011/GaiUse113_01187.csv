1,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_01","Out of concern for her fellow Scions, Tataru has resolved to make a special tonic which she believes will revive their flagging spirits. To that end, she requires highland tea leaves, which are harvested from a rare plant native to Coerthas. Consult with Tataru's acquaintance Medguistl in Camp Dragonhead to learn where you might acquire the necessary ingredient."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_02","Medguistl states that her stores of highland tea leaves were depleted but a few bells prior to your arrival. She advises you to seek out Emanuel the wine seller, who plys his wears in the courtyard of Camp Dragonhead."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_03","Recognizing you from your previous escapades in Coerthas, Emanuel regretfully explains that his next shipment of highland tea leaves has yet to arrive. Since he knows not when his stores will be replenished, he proposes that you harvest the leaves yourself from the plants which grow along the riverbanks in Boulder Downs─adding that you may need mind your surroundings when doing so."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_04","Aggressive wildlife does not deter you from your task, as you successfully harvest highland tea leaves from several plants. Take the tea leaves to Tataru outside the Waking Sands and wash your hands of this second errand."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_SEQ_05","Tataru wastes no time preparing her tonic, and you listen with growing horror as she recites her ingredients in song. Fortunately, you are spared full knowledge of the recipe, as she abruptly remembers that a crisis has erupted in your absence."

50,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_TATARU_000_002","Convincing them to take time to rest may not be an option, but I think I can improve morale by improving their dietary health. I know just the way to do it, too: by making a special tonic which is certain to revive their flagging spirits."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_TATARU_000_003","But for that, I require highland tea leaves─and the one merchant I know who sells them is completely out of stock.

54,"TEXT_GAIUSE113_01187_TATARU_000_006","Highland tea leaves don't seem to be a popular commodity outside of Coerthas, so I don't expect that you'll find them for sale here. Nevertheless, they are an essential ingredient for this tonic."
