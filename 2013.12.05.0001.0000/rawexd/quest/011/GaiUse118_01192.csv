1,"TEXT_GAIUSE118_01192_SEQ_01","Rather than traveling en masse, the Scions will depart for Mor Dhona in several small groups. Minfilia has asked you to remain with her until the end; however, she suspects that an important task has been left undone, and bids you attend to Urianger while she attempts to recall what she has forgotten to do."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE118_01192_SEQ_02","While conversing with Urianger about the future of the Waking Sands, you hear a cry from the solar which could only be Minfilia's. After bursting through the doors you find the Antecedent collapsed upon the floor, alive but unmoving. Wielding the power of the Echo, you learn that an Ascian robed in white was present mere moments before, having infiltrated the solar undetected to speak with Minfilia in private. Proclaiming himself an emissary, he speaks cryptically of the Echo and its power, asserting that mastery of this gift would end the hostilities between the Ascians and the children of Hydaelyn. Disoriented but unharmed, Minfilia rises to her feet and commands you to search Vesper Bay for the Ascian, whom she suspects may be lurking nearby."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE118_01192_SEQ_03","You are shocked to find the Ascian standing in the center of Vesper Bay, making no attempt to conceal his presence. Although he recognizes you as the one who faced Lahabrea in the Praetorium, he expresses some doubt as to your true capabilities. Declaring that he shall walk north, he states that you may follow, but warns that you will be waylaid should you choose to do so."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE118_01192_SEQ_04","A trio of imps ambush you outside the gates of Vesper Bay, precisely as the Ascian predicted. Though he does not appear to be present, you cannot shake the sensation that you are being watched..."

7,"TEXT_GAIUSE118_01192_SEQ_07","As the white-robed Ascian watches in silence, four black-robed Ascians emerge and engage you in combat. With their powerful magicks they push you to your mortal limits, but in the end you claim victory. At that moment, you glimpse a grin flash across the remaining Ascian's face. Address him and see what he has to say."
8,"TEXT_GAIUSE118_01192_SEQ_08","“As it was, so shall it be again.” The words of the emissary named Elidibus linger in your memory as you attempt to decipher their meaning.
