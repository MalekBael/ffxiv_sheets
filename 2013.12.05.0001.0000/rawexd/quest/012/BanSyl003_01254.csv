1,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_01","The pseudoscholar Voyce has belatedly come to the conclusion that the sylphs who had captured him are in possession of a seedcradle containing the Chosen One. As he neither understands the full implications of this nor possesses the courage to investigate the matter himself, he bids you to speak with Olmxio."
2,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_02","Aghast at hearing that the Chosen One is in the nasty ones' clutches, Olmxio urges you to go in search of the bulb at once, casting a spell of transparency upon you to aid in quest. Infiltrate the Sylphlands and spy upon the touched sylphs, that you might ascertain the location of the Chosen One's seedcradle.

※This task must be completed before the enchantment expires. The (...) you may encounter on your path will extend the duration of the spell."
3,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_03","To your fortune, the heedless sylph tasked with transporting the seedcradle has misplaced his charge somewhere near the entrance to the Sylphlands. Hurry and find it before the touched ones do!"
4,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_04","You have secured the cradle, which is a great deal weightier than you imagined. Safely transport it back to Little Solace while the strength in your arms remains.

※Should your strength begin to wane, you may find respite at the (...) along the way."
5,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_05","The Chosen One's seedcradle now rests safely in Little Solace. Inform Voyce that you were able to succeed in the task without his help."
6,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_SEQ_06","While relieved that the Chosen One is safe, Elder Frixio does not believe that the touched ones will give up so easily, and warns you to be wary of a counterattack."

49,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_002","Are you perchance familiar with how baby sylphs are born? Perhaps I can put it in layman's terms. You see, sylphs come into this world in the form of a bulb, not unlike certain types of flora."
50,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_003","But these bulbs will not sprout into a sylph of their own volition. No, they must be incubated within a special plant that the sylphs call a seedcradle. Given sufficient warmth and nutrition, then─and only then─will a newborn sylph emerge."
51,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_004","This got me to thinking─those frightful sylphs that tried to kill me spoke of seedcradles, did they not? Now, if my hypothesis is correct..."
52,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_005","Yes, surely the Chosen One slumbers in a cradle even as we speak! Why, come to think of it, I vaguely recall my captors saying precisely as much!"
53,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_VOYCE_000_006","So, what say you, friend? Shall we venture forth in search of this... Hm? My cough? Come to think of it, I am still feeling a bit...<cough>...weak. Might you share my discovery with Olmxio while I recuperate a bit more?"
54,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_000_011","Bumbling one said what!? The Chosen One slumbers at the Seedbed! Why did bumbling one not tell this one sooner!? There is no time to lose!"
55,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_000_012","Walking one must become running one, and retrieve Chosen One's bulb from Seedbed with all speed!"
56,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_001_012","This one can help. This one uses see-through magic, so that walking one becomes hidden one."
57,"TEXT_BANSYL003_01254_OLMXIO_000_013","But be careful─see-through magic will not last long. If nasty ones see walking one, walking one is in trouble. Now hurry, and find Chosen One!"
