1,"TEXT_SUBCTS102_01216_SEQ_01","His voice trembling with a palpable fear, Hugubert speaks of ill tidings from the mines of Copperbell. The fiendish hecatoncheires─believed to have been driven back to the umbral depths─have resurfaced, and many a roseate miner has paid the eternal price for resuming their work too hastily. He encourages you to speak to the Stone Torch posted outside the mines in western Thanalan to see if aught can be done about the situation."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS102_01216_SEQ_02","The proud Stone Torch admits, albeit grudgingly, that the reinvigorated hecatoncheires that plague the mines have proven too formidable a foe for his unit to handle. Indeed, the entire mining operation is at risk for termination if this new threat is not dealt with, and swiftly. It would seem that once more Copperbell dost want for an adventurer's capable hand.
