The leader of the dragoons is known as the Azure Dragoon, and is chosen by the Eye, a relic guarded within the Holy See which bestows upon the chosen one the power of the dragon."
11,"TEXT_JOBDEFDRG_00092_ALBERIC_000_8","And yet this power is as a double-edged sword, for if the dragoon does not maintain absolute control over his emotions, he shall fall under the thrall of the very wyrms that he would slay. But so it always has been─no great power comes without a cost."
