1,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_011","The doctrine of overwhelming force that many follow has not always been successful, you see. Ancient Nym, in particular, is said to have defended itself from numerous invasions, despite possessing only a token force of mariners and mages."
2,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_012","Indeed, I believe there is much we can learn by studying the military tactics of old. I hope one day to persuade my brethren of this fact, so that we might grow as an organization."

9,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_021","Though they were far fewer in number relative to the mariners, it is clear that these mages formed the backbone of the Nymian military."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_022","One might describe their role as one which provides support, but that does not adequately describe their capabilities, as far as I am concerned."

21,"TEXT_JOBDEFSCH_00098_ALKAZOLKA_000_101","However, as is often the case in academic research, it is the unexpected discoveries which prove the most fascinating. I must confess that I am tempted to broaden the scope of my studies. But that is a conversation for another day."
