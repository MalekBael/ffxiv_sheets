2,"TEXT_JOBDEFSMN_00097_YMHITRA_000_012","Due to a number of fascinating finds, it is the ruins of Mor Dhona that presently command the bulk of our attention. I am here, however, to conduct some...preliminary research."
3,"TEXT_JOBDEFSMN_00097_YMHITRA_000_013","The tales my sister wove of the wild realm of Eorzea were what first encouraged me to visit. But beyond that initial curiosity, there is much in this land to interest an avid scholar."
