Smoldering rock doesn't make for good farmland, you see. In the old days, the warriors of our clan traveled far and wide, earning good coin for their esteemed services."
9,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_7","In recent years, however, we find ourselves shunned by those selfsame peoples we once protected. This, in turn, has led to more and more of our young ones choosing to forsake the warrior's path. A sad fate for our once-proud tribe, it is."
10,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_8","And so I have traveled here, with no possessions save the armor on my back and the ancient text passed down from my ancestors. A text that tells of the history and techniques of my people─and, sadly, a text I can scarcely read."

17,"TEXT_JOBDEFWAR_00090_CURIOUSGORGE_000_101","As such, I devote the better part of my days to my training, mind as well as body. And when Wineport calls for aid, I answer. These humble efforts alone cannot begin to atone for the suffering caused by the beast, but I must do what I can."
