1,"TEXT_JOBDEFWHM_00095_RAYAOSENNA_000_011","My name may be unfamiliar to you, but doubtless you know of my sister. That would be Kan–E–Senna, Elder Seedseer of Gridania and supreme commander of the Order of the Twin Adder."

4,"TEXT_JOBDEFWHM_00095_RAYAOSENNA_000_014","This is an art for which we have no small need. The Twelveswood has been made to suffer unspeakable pains: from the Calamity, to unending conflicts with the beast tribes, to exploitation at the hands of our own people... It is my duty─my calling─to provide succor, and I do it gladly."

12,"TEXT_JOBDEFWHM_00095_RAYAOSENNA_000_022","Her magic was that of destruction: black magic. The people of Amdapor felt this power was too great to be allowed to go unchecked, and so it was that white magic─the magic of healing and solace─was born."
13,"TEXT_JOBDEFWHM_00095_RAYAOSENNA_000_023","So it was that the forces of magic were brought into equilibrium, and civilization flourished. But this era of peace and prosperity would prove short-lived. War broke out, and the realm was thrown into chaos."

17,"TEXT_JOBDEFWHM_00095_RAYAOSENNA_000_027","The elementals of the forest, knowing that men could not be trusted to keep such vows, took action as well. The Twelveswood grew, swallowing the ruins of Amdapor, and the power of white magic was sealed away deep in the forest, far from the reach of mortals."
18,"TEXT_JOBDEFWHM_00095_RAYAOSENNA_000_028","Ages passed, until five centuries ago, the elementals at long last welcomed people back into the forest.

It is from the elementals themselves that we inherited white magic."
