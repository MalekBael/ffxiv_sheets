1,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_A1_000_2","What is leatherworking?"
4,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_2","I'm in charge around here. I'm the chief, or the guildmaster, or whatever you prefer to call it."
6,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_3","The Leatherworkers' Guild was moderately famous before I took over, but it was under my direction that it became Eorzea's premier source of leather goods."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_4","Mayhap you imagine that I toiled tirelessly to achieve this, that I endured innumerable trials and tribulations, and that the story of my personal journey would move an amphitheatre audience to tears."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_5","Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it was actually quite easy. The secret to our success is simple: we craft superior goods that exceed expectations, and we do so by paying due respect to both our materials and our customers."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_6","As to how we go about this, I would say it is by focusing on the fundamentals. It's common sense, really. If you strive for perfection and always give of your best, fame and fortune will naturally follow."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_10","Leatherworking is about respect─a leatherworker must remember the lives sacrificed for his materials, and honor them by crafting quality goods that will stand the test of time."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_11","As an adventurer, mayhap you have worn leather jackets, boots, belts, or other such equipment. If so, these items were─I hope─crafted with care and respect by a dedicated leatherworker."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_12","It is a regrettable truth, but leatherworking, by its nature, requires the taking of life. It can be difficult for some to come to terms with this, but until they have, they cannot claim to have given their materials the respect they are due."
13,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_13","Of course, respect must also be given to our customers, for they are the ones who will ultimately judge if our work is wanting."
14,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_14","It is the duty of every leatherworker to embrace his personal responsibility to the creature sacrificed and the customer served. He who fails in this is a butcher and a charlatan."
15,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_020","Well, if it isn't my favorite apprentice. <If(Equal(PlayerParameter(68),12))>I certainly hope you haven't been resting on your laurels, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Now that you've made a name for yourself, I'm expecting only the best from you, and you wouldn't want to see me disappointed.<Else/>I almost didn't recognize you in that ridiculous getup, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. You'd best have a good excuse for showing up without your leatherworker's gear.</If>"
16,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_030","Hm? You must have terribly urgent business to risk showing your face in public."
17,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_031","Well, so long as you remain within these walls, you needn't fear reprisals. If any here attempt to lay so much as a finger on my favorite apprentice, I'll flay the offending digits."
18,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_Q2_000_1","What will you ask?"
19,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_A2_000_1","How fares the guild?"

22,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_100","If you're looking for another round of accolades for your showing at the exhibition, you've come to the wrong place─but you knew that already."
23,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_101","That said, just between the two of us, the whole Angrbotha ordeal taught me a valuable lesson. For all my talk about respect, there are those out there who lack even the most fundamental understanding of what we stand for."
24,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_102","I may pride myself on being a stern taskmaster, but all my screaming and shouting will go for naught if my own work doesn't embody the virtues I preach. You'd do well to remember this, too, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>, if you've a mind to represent us in your travels across the realm."
25,"TEXT_REGFSTTANGUILD_00030_GEVA_000_110","Leatherworking is what I do, and what you <Emphasis>did</Emphasis> before I revoked your membership and kicked you out the door for asking such a ridiculous question. <sigh> Very well, listen up. If you're going waste my time, you could at least pass my words to the loungers and laggards around here and spare my voice some."
