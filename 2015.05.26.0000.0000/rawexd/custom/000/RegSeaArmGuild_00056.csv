0,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_1","Are you just seeking to pass the time, or do you have an honest interest in armorcraft?"
1,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_Q1_000_1","What would you like to know?"
2,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A1_000_2","Tell me about crafting armor."
4,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_2","Me? Hah! You must be new in Limsa. I'm H'naanza, the head of Naldiq & Vymelli's, forgemaster and shipwright."
6,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_3","I spend a good portion of my time here in the Armorers' Guild, trying to hammer my novices into something resembling true artisans."
7,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_4","We lost too many of our skilled veterans to that damn Calamity. Too many..."
8,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_100_4","I see it as my Builder-given duty to not only pass on the techniques of the armorer to the next generation of artisans, but to improve on those processes as well."
9,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_5","At a glance, working a sheet of plate seems simple. You take your chosen metal, then heat, hammer, and bend until you achieve the desired shape and thickness."
10,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_6","There is, however, much more to the process. An armorer needs to learn how to work materials of varying hardness, such as bronze and iron. And shaping them into gauntlets, shields, and helmets is no easy task."
11,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_7","You must direct your blows with strength and surety as would a smitty, but an armorer needs something a smitty doesn't: delicacy. Without that, it wouldn't be long before tiny flaws crept in to compromise the defensive strength of the plate."
12,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_8","We make works of art with flame and steel, and there's never a day that I'm not damn proud to be an armorer."
13,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_010","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Have you come to help hammer the dents out of some of my novices, or was there something else I could do for you?"
14,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_020","Greetings, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Seems you've a knack for landing yourself in the midst of ugly situations. But not to worry─once the blaze dies down, the purity of your steel will be revealed for all to see."
15,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_021","Stay here as long as you please. My hammer and I will see to any characters foolish enough to seek trouble at <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> forge."
16,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
17,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A2_000_001","How fares the guild?"
18,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A2_000_002","What can you tell me of armorcraft?"
19,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_A2_000_003","Nothing."
20,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_100","There has been scant trouble to speak of─especially since Blanstyr made the decision to distance himself from our forges."
21,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_101","But though the guild has been blessedly free of friction, this was not necessarily the outcome for which I had hoped."
22,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_102","Far better if he were to have embraced the idea of friendly rivalry. Alas, such a fundamental shift in perspective will not be soon in the offing for a stubborn old aurochs like him."
23,"TEXT_REGSEAARMGUILD_00056_HNAANZA_000_110","You wish me to lecture you like you were a fresh-faced initiate? An odd request, but not as uncommon as you might think. Very well─stand up straight, and pay attention!"
