11,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_023","“Spare the rod and spoil the adventurer,” as they say. You'll not need an army aboard a dreadnaught to catch a fish─you will need only a rod and your wits."
12,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_024","Quite fitting for a self-sufficient adventurer like yourself, do you not agree? After all, what sort of adventurer wants to browse the nets for hours upon hours when you could be enjoying the great outdoors with a rod and reel?"
13,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_030","Well, look what the coeurl dragged in. How goes it, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
14,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_040","Now there's a sight for sore eyes. I believed the Admiral when she said you wriggled through the Ul'dahns' nets, but it's still a comfort to find you here in the flesh."
15,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_041","Aye, most people in positions of power know all about your situation. Wawalago doesn't know a thing, though─and I've a mind to keep it that way. He'd never let a fish slip free from his hook, but a secret from his lips? Now that's a different story."

21,"TEXT_REGSEAFSHGUILD_00088_SISIPU_000_101","Which is to say that the fishermen are fishing, the guildmaster is gallivanting, and I'm still saddled with administrative duties."
