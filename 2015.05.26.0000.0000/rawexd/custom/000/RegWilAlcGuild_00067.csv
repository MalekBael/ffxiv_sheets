1,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A1_000_2","What does an alchemist do?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_010","What do I do here? Well, I certainly don't stand around answering fanciful questions! ...But I can see you plan to pester me until I do."
6,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_011","I am Severian, and, by some twist of fate's unfathomable humor, I serve as guildmaster to this insufferable gathering of alchemists."
7,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_012","Were you expecting a joyous union of cooperation and camaraderie? Hmph. Most of these fellows began as bitter rivals, and few of them are eager to share the results of their research."
8,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_013","It seems the only thing we can agree on is punishing the detestable practice of peddling false potions. Ruins our collective reputation, you understand. It is quite a sight to see the apprehended criminal subjected to a veritable shower of experimental concoctions!"
9,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_020","To properly define the intricate and miraculous work of an alchemist would take days of lengthy explanation─an explanation that you would most likely fail to understand. The simple appellation of “potion brewer” given to us by the masses is, however, largely accurate."
10,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_021","Restorative salves, ability-enhancing elixirs, deadly toxins and poisons─these are all substances that can be created through our versatile and practical profession."
11,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_022","With the proper knowledge and process, even the most worthless-seeming materials can be combined to produce wondrous compounds. The applications of alchemy are nearly limitless!"
12,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_050","Ah, my faithful assistant. Have you come to share some wonderful discovery from the boundless realm of alchemical potential?"
13,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_060","Ah, my faithful assistant. Though the details have quite slipped my mind, I was told you were involved in some outrageous incident at the royal palace. Why waste your time on such frivolities, when you could be exploring the uncharted regions of advanced alchemy!?"
14,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_061","If any seek to interrupt your research, then you need merely douse the knave with the most suitable concoction at hand! Mwahaha! The practical application of results is at the heart of our discipline!"
15,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"

17,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_A2_000_002","What can you tell me of alchemy?"

19,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_100","Hah! Despite all the myriad possibilities of our craft that beg to be explored, you would inquire as to <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> well-being? Well, naturally I am spending every waking hour exploring the myriad possibilities of our craft!"
20,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_101","Though I have stood at what I thought to be the very peak of alchemical achievement, it was but one mountain among many that I now hope to conquer. And, as I work towards my goals, I even deign to accept a commission or two."
21,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_102","<sigh> I only wish that the requests of the wealthy were not so insufferably dull. If coin is no object, then why not ask of me a truly daunting and difficult task?"
22,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_103","Have you made no boastworthy discoveries of late? Remember: the world is our crucible, and an alchemist makes marvels of the mundane!"
23,"TEXT_REGWILALCGUILD_00067_SEVERIAN_000_110","You who have studied─some would say “suffered”─at my feet would know more of that subject than most. But I will, however, indulge your request with bemused magnanimity!"
