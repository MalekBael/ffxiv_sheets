1,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_A1_000_2","What is a gladiator?"

5,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_010","Well, I don't just stand around gawping, if that's what you're asking. I am Mylla, guildmaster here."
6,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_011","I instruct these would-be warriors on the finer points of swordsmanship. If you like, I could teach you a thing or two as well, though I can't promise to be gentle."
7,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_012","You'll be bruised and bloody by the time we're finished, but I guarantee you'll be stronger for it. Observe our training and see for yourself."
8,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_020","Gladiators aspire to become masters of the sword, the most ubiquitous weapon in all of Eorzea."
9,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_021","The sword is a deceptively simple weapon, which is why many take it up to achieve their goals. Wealth, power, love─all seem within reach when duly armed."
10,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_022","A gladiator, however, understands that to live by the sword is not a decision to be taken lightly. To walk upon the bloodsands is to court death, and we must ever be prepared to enter Thal's realm."
11,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_023","But when you stand triumphant in the Coliseum and hear the crowd chanting your name, you feel...immortal."
12,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_024","Of course, victory goes only to those willing to work for it. A gladiator must rigorously train not only to deliver fierce attacks, but also to weather them. Indeed, learning the shield is just as important as learning the sword."
13,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_025","These defensive skills are especially important when fighting alongside allies. In battle, a gladiator is often relied upon to draw the enemy's attention while his weaker allies seize the opportunity to attack."
14,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_026","It is for this reason that gladiators are often considered indispensable in battle, for none are more skilled in the arts of war than we."

16,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_060","It's not every day a famous free paladin darkens our door. To what do we owe the pleasure, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?"
17,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_070","You are yet welcome here, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

24,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_102","More importantly, any time you waste worrying about the affairs of others would be better spent further honing your skills."
25,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_110","The life of a gladiator is never easy, but I cannot complain. Certain members of the guild have achieved greater recognition in recent days, which has led to a surge of applicants."
26,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_111","They are eager to learn, I will grant them that. Yet they struggle to grasp the basics still. For example, the other day I was explaining the concept of eliciting an opponent's enmity. Surely you recall the lesson? It involved shouting at marauders."
27,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_112","One recruit took forever and a day to understand that his words were not enough, and that he needed to motion to himself to achieve the full effect. Even now, I cannot fathom why he struggled so..."
28,"TEXT_REGWILGLAGUILD_00063_MYLLA_000_120","Who are you, and what did you do with <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>? Because I know <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> wouldn't be so daft as to─ Oh, the hells with it."
