1,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_2","What is goldsmithing?"
4,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A1_000_4","Can I have another set of earrings?"
6,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_010","People call me Mistress Serendipity, but you can call me Sera!"
7,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_011","I was recently appointed guildmaster, so this is all still quite new to me. My predecessor abruptly retired, you see...but that's a long, sordid story that I'm sure you'd rather not hear."
8,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_012","Now, I may not have much experience managing people, but I <Emphasis>am</Emphasis> a very good goldsmith─even if I do say so myself! Those who train under me are guaranteed to learn a thing or two!"
9,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_020","Though we're called <Emphasis>gold</Emphasis>smiths, we actually work with various kinds of precious metals and gemstones, all of which are abundant in Thanalan."
10,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_021","Smelting, casting, cutting, polishing─we use all these techniques to craft beautiful baubles that delight the eyes."
11,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_022","Mind you, the things we make aren't simply for show─a great many possess magical properties. And of course, we craft scepters and staves that thaumaturges use to channel their magicks."
12,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_023","When you think about all the variety goldsmithing has to offer, it's really quite exciting!"
13,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_030","You want <Emphasis>what</Emphasis>!? You can't be serious! <Emphasis>Gods</Emphasis>..."
14,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_031","Just this once, but remember─life is not a minstrel's song, and you aren't some chosen hero. So don't go around expecting people to forgive you no matter the reckless, irresponsible things you do."
15,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_040","Why, hello there, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. How is our little princess doing?"
16,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_041","Sorry, sorry. That was a bit rude of me, wasn't it. How are <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> doing?"
17,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_050","Ah! <Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>! How's every little thing? You haven't been trying to repair mammets behind my back, have you?"
18,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_061","<Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Are the rumors true? Are you the victim of a vast conspiracy!? Oh dear, I probably shouldn't speak so loudly..."
19,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_062","I've given thought to how we might distract your pursuers. Perhaps a mammet fashioned in your image which nods at regular intervals? No? Hmmm...I was rather proud of that idea..."
20,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_Q2_000_001","What will you ask?"
21,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_001","How fares the guild?"
22,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_A2_000_002","What is goldsmithing?"

25,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_100","So very, very busy! Our members are working day and night to fill commissions for clients throughout Eorzea, and of course I must supervise. I swear, sometimes it feels as though I never leave this spot!"
26,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_101","I like that it keeps me occupied. When it's not so busy, I start to wonder about silly things, like if he would've really pulled the trigger..."
27,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_102","Perhaps I'm due for a sabbatical. I've been thinking about it more ever since a client of ours invited me to his beachside holdings in eastern La Noscea."
28,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_103","Of course, the moment I tell Gigi about Gegeruju's offer, he begins raving about “secrets and lies” again. I mean, I know Gigi was right about Robert or whatever his name was, but what ulterior motives could Gegeruju possibly have?"
29,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_110","Ahaha─ Oh, you're serious. Well, if you really want me to explain it to you..."

33,"TEXT_REGWILGLDGUILD_00068_SERENDIPITY_000_114","...Out of curiosity, are you feeling well? You didn't hit your head on something, did you? No? Hmmm... Maybe you don't remember doing it...?"
