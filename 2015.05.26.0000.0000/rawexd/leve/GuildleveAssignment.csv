33,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_GUILDLEVE_00","In a realm as large as this one, there will always be those who are looking for someone willing to assist them with their troubles. Instead of doing the searching on their own, they often come to the Adventurers' Guild. The guild, in turn, documents their petitions and then offers them to its members."
34,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_GUILDLEVE_01","These tasks are called “levequests,” and if someone happens to be interested in accepting one, the guild presents <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> with a guildleve that is used in conjunction with the quest. Guildleves are, in effect, passes which grant their bearers “leave” to perform various actions which might otherwise be prohibited, such as the eradication of beasts, admittance to restricted areas, and more."
35,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_TICKET_00","To ensure that the available tasks are distributed evenly amongst all those who seek employment, the guild has placed a limit on the number of leves that an adventurer can accept at any one time."
36,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_TICKET_01","Every twelve hours (Earth time) adventurers will receive three <Color(-34022)>leve allowances</Color>. These allowances can be used to purchase new leves, or re-challenge those which were failed or abandoned. The maximum number of allowances one can possess is one hundred."
37,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_LEVE_LINK_00","When multiple party members all possess the same battlecraft leve, they will have the opportunity to perform what is called a “leve link.”"
38,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_LEVE_LINK_01","This will assure that due credit is given for the completion of the task, and prevent the need for repeating the same levequest twice."
39,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_BATTLE_LEVE_00","Battlecraft leves are intended for Disciples of War or Magic, as they most often involve the slaying or pacification of a target. After obtaining the corresponding leve plate, these quests can be initiated from your journal."
40,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_GATHERING_LEVE_00","Fieldcraft leves are intended for Disciples of the Land, and require that the proper tools be equipped before initiating via your journal or the duty list. Fishing leves, while classified as fieldcraft leves, are conducted in manner similar to tradecraft leves in that they are initiated as soon as you obtain the plates."
41,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_GATHERING_LEVE_01","Also, fieldcraft levequests other than those of the fishing variety must be performed alone."
42,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_CRAFT_LEVE_00","Tradecraft leves are intended for Disciples of the Hand, and unlike other types of levequests, have no time limits, and are initiated automatically upon obtaining the plates."
43,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_CRAFT_LEVE_01","Once a levequest objective has been crafted, it must be delivered personally to the client to collect your reward. The client can be confirmed in your journal."
44,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_WANTED_00","On rare occasions while undertaking battlecraft levequests, you will come across creatures with bounties on their heads."
45,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_WANTED_01","While you need not engage them to complete your levequest objectives, slaying the wanted targets will earn you the price of their bounty."
46,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_TREASURE_00","If you happen to discover a treasure coffer while on a levequest, you are entitled to the contents within, as are your party members."
47,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_TREASURE_01","All party members should check the coffer individually, as not to miss out on their share of the loot."
48,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_FACTION_00","Eorzea plays host to numerous civilian organizations, both great and small, which represent the many and varied interests of her people. Three of the largest and most influential of these take a keen interest in adventurer activity."
49,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_FACTION_01","They are the Brotherhood of the Broken Blade―a group of vigilantes who are convinced the beast tribes will one day destroy the realm, unless they destroy them first; Azeyma's Shields―self-proclaimed protectors of the weak and enemies of evil; and the Horn and Hand―a band of scholars and scientists, merchants and moneylenders who seek to gain fame (and fortune) by aiding in the outfitting of adventurers."
50,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_FACTION_02","To extend their influence throughout Eorzea, each of these “factions” sponsors levequests which coincide with their particular area of interest. Completing a levequest sponsored by a certain faction not only earns you “credits,” but also increases the influence that faction has in the area where the levequest was completed."
51,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_FACTION_03","Faction credits earned after completing levequests can be used to gain access to special missions offered only to loyal followers. The factions often reward those who complete these tasks with rare items or generous amounts of gil."
52,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_HISTORY_00","Leve history evaluation is a fairly new initiative taken by the Adventurers' Guild to help provide skilled adventurers with tasks that best fit their abilities, while rewarding them for continued contribution to the city–state and realm."
53,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_HISTORY_01","A record of completed levequests can be found in your <Color(-34022)>Leve History</Color> located in your <Color(-34022)>Journal</Color>. You must have completed at least six quests to be eligible for evaluation. Once an adventurer's past performance has been evaluated, he or she will be provided with a new quest in exchange for the used leve plates."
54,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_HISTORY_02","What is more, additional monetary or item bonuses will be awarded to those who succeed in fulfilling the new leve's objectives. These bonuses fluctuate depending on the original history evaluation, with certain combinations of leves earning adventurers better rewards than others."
55,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_HISTORY_03","To accept this new leve, you will be required to use one of your leve allowances. Faction leves, if offered, will never require credits."
56,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_COMPANY_LEVE00","Two types of tasks are offered here─one being Grand Company levequests, the other being supply and provisioning missions."
57,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_COMPANY_LEVE01","Grand Company levequests are various one-man tasks that have been deemed too important or dangerous to place in the hands of a normal adventurer."
58,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_COMPANY_LEVE02","The Eorzean Alliance charter states that Grand Company levequests are to be made available to all adventurers enlisted in a Grand Company, regardless of allegiance."
59,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_COMPANY_LEVE03","However, Grand Companies will often provide members with bonuses for undertaking their own company's leves."
60,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_COMPANY_LEVE04","There are also other bonuses rewarded based on performance."
61,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_EXPLAIN_COMPANY_LEVE05","Supply and provisioning missions entail the crafting or gathering and subsequent delivery of items requested by individual Grand Companies."
62,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_CRAFT_LEVE_HOWTO_00","Tradecraft leves involve the crafting and delivery of various items."
63,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_CRAFT_LEVE_HOWTO_01","Depending on the client's needs, the items requested might range from simple weapons to ornate jewelry."
64,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_GATHERING_LEVE_HOWTO_00","Fieldcraft leves involve the locating and gathering of various items found occurring in nature."
65,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_GATHERING_LEVE_HOWTO_01","Depending on the type of item, you may need to journey into areas inhabited by powerful creatures."
66,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_GATHERING_LEVE_HOWTO_02","It is recommended that, for these tasks, you employ stealth."
67,"TEXT_GUILDLEVEASSIGNMENT_TALK_COMPANY_LEVE_HOWTO_00","Grand Company levequests are various one-man tasks that have been deemed too important or dangerous to place in the hands of a normal adventurer."
