49,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_2","We pugilists are specialists in hand-to-hand combat. Through rigorous training, we forge devastating weapons of our fists and feet, which we employ to great effect in battle."
50,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_3","There is no better place in all the realm to train in our discipline than here. If you would walk the path of the pugilist, I highly recommend you add your name to our roll. What say you, friend?"
51,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_Q1_000_1","Join the Pugilists' Guild?"

56,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_21","Hmmm... Looking closely at your physique, it would seem you are still somewhat...<Emphasis>soft</Emphasis>."
57,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_22","I'm afraid the guild requires a basic level of fitness in its recruits. You must condition your body further before you can join us."
58,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_SYSTEM_000_23","Before you can take up another discipline, you must first complete the level 10 quest of your starting class."
59,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_31","A decision you'll not regret! But before we proceed to the paperwork, it is essential that you know something of our guild's storied past."
60,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_32","Since time immemorial, man has used whatever has been at his disposal to settle disputes. In the beginning, that meant fighting with his fists. Such hand-to-hand combat existed in various forms throughout Eorzea, each evolving independently of one another."
61,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_33","The origins of pugilism as we know it, however, can be traced back to the staging of bare-handed bouts at the Coliseum. These contests attracted fighters from far and wide, bringing their myriad styles crashing together on the bloodsands."
62,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_34","Amidst this chaotic intermingling of styles, there rose a pugilist of singular strength and skill. This woman made it her life's mission to master every form she encountered, that she might refine her art."
63,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_35","Among her many song-worthy exploits, we pugilists remember her participation in a gladiator tournament most fondly. Back when bare-handed fighting was still seen as a pastime for peasants, she took on fully armed and armored gladiators, and effortlessly bested the lot of them."
64,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_36","Word of her feat spread across the realm like wildfire, of course, and Ul'dah swiftly transformed into a center of pugilism, with people flocking from all over to train under this master among masters."
65,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_37","The woman's name was Cornelia, and it is to her that the Pugilists' Guild owes its existence. The art practiced here is based on her all-encompassing style, and this training hall is modeled upon the one which she once built."
66,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_38","And there it is─a brief history of our guild."
67,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_39","I've told this tale a thousand times, but gods, it never fails to fan the flames of my fighting spirit!"
68,"TEXT_CLSPGL001_00178_GAGARUNA_000_40","Now then, before we can proceed with your enrollment, you must first obtain the guildmaster's approval. Let me know when you are ready to meet him."
