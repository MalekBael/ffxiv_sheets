Unfortunately, he's run out of hi-potions and cannot leave his post to obtain more from the merchant at the Bannock. Help Arold by bringing him the medication he needs."

I caught a scurry of squirrels gnawing on the fences earlier. I managed to drive them off, but not before they decided to gnaw on <Emphasis>me</Emphasis> instead! And now I'm the bloody mess you see before you."

I vaguely recall using my last one after some trifling scrape several moons past... The gods alone know why I didn't think to replace it there and then. You wouldn't happen to be carrying a spare flask?"
50,"TEXT_SUBFST029_00172_AROLD_000_3","If you don't have any on hand, the merchant at the Bannock should have some in her stock. I can't leave my post, so if you could bring me a hi-potion, I'd be tremendously grateful."

Ah, you're back! Do you have that hi-potion for me?"

53,"TEXT_SUBFST029_00172_AROLD_000_12","I had no idea squirrels could bite so <Emphasis>hard</Emphasis>! I thought I had seen everything, but it seems there are still surprises to be found in the Twelveswood. We both would do well to remember that."
