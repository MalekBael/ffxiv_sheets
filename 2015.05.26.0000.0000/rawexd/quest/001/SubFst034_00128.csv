55,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_MONRANGUIN_000_14","Indeed, a single outbreak once claimed the lives of a third of the Hyuran population here in Gridania. That was a long time ago, of course. With the medicines available to us now, the Creeping Death is not the killer it once was."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST034_00128_MONRANGUIN_000_15","Even so, it is best to halt any new outbreaks before they occur. Thus we gather chigoe eggs on a regular basis in order to assist the Trappers' League with their ongoing research. Your timely assistance is most appreciated."
