1,"TEXT_CLSBSM251_00297_SEQ_01","Hoping to win new contracts for the guild, Brithael has asked you to produce another sample. Craft a high-quality steel ingot and deliver it to Faezahr, who will once again handle negotiations."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM251_00297_SEQ_02","Your expertly forged steel serves to elevate you further in Faezahr's esteem, but his opinion of Brithael remains as low as ever. Despite his scorn for the forgemaster, he pledges to recommend the guild's services to prospective clients.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 30."

50,"TEXT_CLSBSM251_00297_BRITHAEL_000_3","If ye've no motivation, it's only a matter o' time before yer work starts to suffer. Yer customers start lookin' elsewhere, folks start whisperin' yer best days're behind ye, yer wife runs off with a godsdamned merchant..."

56,"TEXT_CLSBSM251_00297_BRITHAEL_000_9","But I know yer up to the task, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. When ye've made the thing, give it to that whoreson merchant from before─Faezahr, aye─so as he can deliver it to the client."
