49,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_2","Mark me, then: if you <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> put it down, and worse, <Emphasis>lose</Emphasis> the bloody thing, I shall use mine own saw to demonstrate to you the pain of losing a limb."
50,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_3","Ah, but I jest. One-armed carpenters are scarcely <Emphasis>half</Emphasis> as useful, in my experience."
51,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_4","In any case, merely holding a saw does not make you a carpenter, whatever some might think. You must become one with it, and learn to feel with it as you work the wood."
52,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_5","To wit, you must first <Emphasis>know</Emphasis> the wood. Demonstrate your knowledge by bringing me a length of maple lumber."

54,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_7","Our man Ferreol, by the entrance, will furnish you with such logs for a nominal price."
55,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_8","Of course, any fool knows that fresh-cut logs are laden with water."

62,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_31","Yes...I feel it. The wood tells all."
63,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_32","There were no careless cuts. Saw and carpenter moved as one, as if dancing."
64,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_33","Do you see this grain, how it flows softly, like syrup?"
65,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_34","Durable yet pliant, suitable for weapons and armor both─this, child, is maple."
66,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_35","Trace the grain with your fingertips and memorize the lines. Consider every characteristic when choosing your materials."
67,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_36","That is what it means to know the wood."
68,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_37","The maple lumber you have brought me is...acceptable. You have passed the first test."
69,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_38","Yet for all it has grown, your knowledge is still lacking. You must needs learn more─a true carpenter knows the qualities and uses of every tree in the forest. When you know the lines of the maple better than those upon your own hand, return to me."
70,"TEXT_CLSWDK100_00205_BEATINE_000_39","I shall have another test for you. Until then, child."
