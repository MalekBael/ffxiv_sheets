...Hm? What do I mean to do with these things, you ask? Why, sell them, of course! They may not look like much at first, but if you dip them in an alchemical concoction, they transform into beautiful red gemstones."
53,"TEXT_SUBWIL090_00339_ZUZUTYRO_012","And these gemstones happen to fetch a <Emphasis>handsome</Emphasis> price in Gridania. Peistes aren't found in the Black Shroud, you see. As a merchant, it's my job to know such things."
