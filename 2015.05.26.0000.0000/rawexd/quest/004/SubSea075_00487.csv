1,"TEXT_SUBSEA075_00487_SEQ_01","Gregory advises you to go pay your respects to other adventurers, as is the custom in Limsa Lominsa. For your first test, he targets Niniya as the recipient of your obeisance. A curious choice, but then again, Gregory is a curious man."

3,"TEXT_SUBSEA075_00487_SEQ_03","While Niniya does not seem displeased by your greeting, she voices a preference for more common parlance.

4,"TEXT_SUBSEA075_00487_SEQ_04","Niniya is pleased, though you cannot tell whether it is by your greeting or your docility. She urges you to save your more formal utterances for the likes of Singing Stormcloud, and what better time than now?"
5,"TEXT_SUBSEA075_00487_SEQ_05","The Roegadyn with the fine contralto has heard of you, and would know more. With the chat mode in <Color(-34022)>Say</Color>, follow Niniya's advice and greet the decorous adventurer by entering “Greetings and salutations!”"
6,"TEXT_SUBSEA075_00487_SEQ_06","Niniya's advice may have been given in jest, but if your reputation had not preceded you, Singing Stormcloud would likely have taken offense. The bluff adventurer tells you to observe Niniya's deeds and not her words, and such sound counsel deserves a <Gui(54)/>Thank you.<Gui(55)/>"
7,"TEXT_SUBSEA075_00487_SEQ_07","After thanking Singing Stormcloud for her advice, she seems more amenable to your forthrightness. Will she be as good as her word and summon you back one day for a worthy cause? Or will nothing more come of this encounter? Only time will tell."
