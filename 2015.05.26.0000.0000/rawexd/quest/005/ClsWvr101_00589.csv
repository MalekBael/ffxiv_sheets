2,"TEXT_CLSWVR101_00589_SEQ_02","Though the guildmaster is grateful for your aid in supplying the Immortal Flames' pressing need, he cannot hide his contempt for the adventurers whose irresponsible behavior occasioned it. Happily, the incident did present you with an opportunity to prove your worth, and Redolent Rose is now of the opinion that you are ready to accept commissions from Eustace at the Quicksand. You have taken a momentous step towards working for the Sunsilk brand.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 15."
