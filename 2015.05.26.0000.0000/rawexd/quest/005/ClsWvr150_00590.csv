1,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_SEQ_01","The guildmaster wishes to reward a regular customer's loyalty with his choice of bespoke garments. Meet with Wawarukka on Onyx Lane and offer your services."
2,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_SEQ_02","Wawarukka is surprised by your generous offer, as he does not consider himself a regular customer, his many purchases having been made on behalf of the Miners' Guild. Loath to look a gift chocobo in the mouth, however, he asks you to craft a cotton scarf and a pair of cotton shepherd's slops for him. Prepare the requested garments and deliver them to Redolent Rose, ready for a final fitting."
3,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_SEQ_03","Although Redolent Rose offers to provide Wawarukka with even finer garments, the miner is more than satisfied with the scarf and slops you have made. The guildmaster can only defer to the customer's decision.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 20."

49,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_001","It is a commission of sorts for one of our regular customers─a gentleman named Wawarukka."
50,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_002","To show our appreciation for his continued patronage, I would present him with his choice of bespoke garments."
51,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_003","Seek him out on Onyx Lane and offer your services. Oh, and remember, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─you are representing me, so acquit yourself accordingly."
52,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_010","Aye, I'm Wawarukka. Who's askin'?"
53,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_011","Ah, hells...Big Rose don't need to go troublin' hisself on my account. All them gloves an' scarves were for the guild, not me."
54,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_012","I'm somethin' of a quartermaster 'round here, see, an' the lads go through gear faster'n a coblyn chewin' on a chunk of mythril."
55,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_013","But if the big man insists, it'd be rude not to accept."
56,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_014","Now then, I reckon I could do with a new, uh...cotton scarf. Aye, an' a pair of cotton shepherd's slops an' all. Ones I've got are on their last legs, see─been meanin' to get 'round to replacin' 'em."
57,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_015","I 'spect you'll be wantin' me to come to the guild for a fittin', will you? See you there, then!"
58,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_020","Don't trouble yourself too much, eh? Long as the scarf don't chafe and the slops don't sag, I'll be more than happy."
59,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_030","A cotton scarf and a pair of cotton shepherd's slops? That's all? Well...let's not keep the customer waiting."
60,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_040","All right then, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
61,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_041","Your garments are ready, good sir. Allow me to help you into them."
62,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_042","Cor! These are nice! <Emphasis>Bloody</Emphasis> nice! I've never had such fine garments before!"
63,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_043","You're a weaver an' half, you are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Big Rose always did know how to train 'em."
64,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_044","You are too kind, sir."
65,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_045","Pardon me for saying so, sir, but I must confess that I had rather...<Emphasis>finer</Emphasis> raiments in mind when I extended you this invitation. Should you desire such, I would be honored to make them for you myself."
66,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_046","Hah hah hah! Thanks, Big Rose, but no thanks. I can't see meself in frilly wotsits. A mine's where I belong, not some fancy ball."
67,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_047","You need a <Emphasis>lady</Emphasis> on your arm to go to them things! Hah! That'll be the day, eh!?"
68,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_WAWARUKKA_048","Anyroad, I'd best get on, but knowin' how fast the lads go through gloves, I daresay I'll be back before too long. Thanks again for the duds!"
69,"TEXT_CLSWVR150_00590_REDOLENTROSE_049","<sigh> You can lead a chocobo to water... Good work, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Carry on."
