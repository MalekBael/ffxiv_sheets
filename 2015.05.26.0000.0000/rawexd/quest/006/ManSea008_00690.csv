1,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_01","The commodore has suggested that you ask Baderon to advise you on where to acquire suitable attire for the banquet. Head to the Drowning Wench and see what her well-connected proprietor has to say."
2,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_02","It seems that your garb lacks the refinement expected of the guest of honor of a state banquet. Baderon tells you to visit J'nasshym at the Octant, and collect a “<If(PlayerParameter(4))>ladylike<Else/>gentlemanly</If>” addition to your wardrobe."
3,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_03","J'nasshym has entrusted you with a raxa-lined box containing your <If(PlayerParameter(4))>“ladylike”<Else/>“gentlemanly”</If> apparel. Return to the Drowning Wench and show the package to Baderon."
4,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_SEQ_04","After handing the box over to Baderon, you discover that it holds a pair of expensive dress shoes. The Wench's proprietor explains that the footwear is a gift from him, and from all the people you have aided on your travels. Speak with Baderon again when you are ready to attend the banquet."

49,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_REYNER_000_2","It is a highly coveted honor. Why, even the officers under her direct command are rarely afforded such recognition!"
50,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_REYNER_000_3","But I will not deny you have earned it. Many of the tasks you have performed in service to the thalassocracy have been both difficult and dangerous."

56,"TEXT_MANSEA008_00690_BADERON_000_12","Well, one thing's fer sure─ye'll not want fer decent grub. These banquets are catered by the bleedin' Bismarck, no less."
