1,"TEXT_GAIUSA307_00739_SEQ_01","Buscarron is vexed by the appearance of Garleans in the Twelveswood. To ease his mind, Auphiliot would have you speak with a Coeurlclaw poacher and a flyer for the Redbelly Wasps, and ask that they keep an eye out for any Garleans they might spy."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA307_00739_SEQ_02","You have asked for the vigilant eyes of both poachers and Wasps alike. Take word of your deeds back to Auphiliot at Buscarron's Druthers."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA307_00739_SEQ_03","It turns out that Auphiliot had more in mind than assuring Buscarron that the Garleans are being kept in check. He also had you meet the poacher and the flyer so that they would know who you are, and that you do not fear them. He hopes such meetings will serve to make you ever more useful to the proprietor and clientele of Buscarron's Druthers."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA307_00739_AUPHILIOT_000_001","So, I came up with a bit of an idea, I did. Might be ye heard, there's a place near to here where poachers an' all other manner o' scum gather."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA307_00739_AUPHILIOT_000_002","They're no friends o' Gridania, to be sure, but they've even less love for Garlemald. So I got to thinkin', why not ask 'em to keep an eye on any Garleans in the wood? Enemy o' my enemy, an' all that."
