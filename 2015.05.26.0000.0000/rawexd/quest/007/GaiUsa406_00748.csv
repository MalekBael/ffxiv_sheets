49,"TEXT_GAIUSA406_00748_HIHIBARU_000_001","I sold everything I owned to get my venture started, and I'm loath to give up without making an earnest effort to stick it out. But if things keep going as they are, I'll be bankrupt before the moon is through..."

58,"TEXT_GAIUSA406_00748_NPCC_000_031","Enough folk have reported seeing him to convince me he's more than a figment of the imagination, but little is known about him otherwise."
