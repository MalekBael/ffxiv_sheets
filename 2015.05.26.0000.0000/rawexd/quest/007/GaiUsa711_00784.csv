1,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_SEQ_01","According to Minfilia, there has been another potential sighting of Lahabrea in the North Shroud. Speak with the sylph Noraxia for the details."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_SEQ_02","Noraxia tells you that a miner named Medrod witnessed an unsavory masked character in the wood. Take yourself to Fallgourd Float in the North Shroud, and learn all you can from him."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_SEQ_03","You find Medrod at Fallgourd Float, but the man is too perturbed to speak of his experience. Perhaps his companion at the table can help to settle him down."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_SEQ_04","According to Aideen, nothing calms Medrod like a serving of lentils and chestnuts, his mother's specialty. Obtain a sample of this dish and bring it to him."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_SEQ_05","You have brought Medrod his favorite dish, but it will take a bit more effort on your part to calm his frayed nerves. For want of a better idea, try to /soothe the man."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_SEQ_06","Medrod finally settles down and recounts his bloodcurdling experience seeing the masked man, who he swears is death incarnate. As Minfilia mentioned, it appears that this individual is indeed connected to the recent spate of mysterious deaths."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MINFILIA_000_001","An individual fitting Lahabrea's description has been sighted in the North Shroud. This sighting comes in the wake of a series of mysterious deaths in the selfsame area. My instincts tell me that our man is involved."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MINFILIA_000_002","I would have you continue your investigation where you left off. Twelve willing, we will pick up Lahabrea's trail once more."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_NORAXIA_000_012","Walking one should go and speak with digging one Medrod. Digging one is to be found at Fallgourd Float in the North Shroud."

58,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_AIDEEN_000_030","You wanted words with Medrod? Well, as you can see, that might be...tricky. He's been this way near a fortnight. If you need him to make sense in a hurry, might be as I can give you some advice. Though he looks a man grown, Medrod's still a little boy on the inside."
59,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_AIDEEN_000_031","You might try feeding him a serving of lentils and chestnuts, his mother's specialty. Stuff should be easy enough to find in Gridania. Oh, and a few <Color(-34022)>soothing</Color> words wouldn't go astray either. Nothing like Mummy's cooking and her expert ministrations for a skinned knee, as it were."

62,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MEDROD_000_050","I don't care how much of my favoritest dish you give me! Nothing on Hydaelyn is worse than what I saw... Nothing!"
63,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MEDROD_000_060","...Y-You're right. It's not as bad as it seems. I saw something terrible, that's true, but that hardly means I'm going to suffer the same fate. Thanks to you, I can think straight again. I believe I can even recount what I saw without losing it."
64,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MEDROD_000_061","It was just another ordinary day. I was headed back to the Float when I noticed a suspicious character in the distance─a masked man garbed head to toe in black. He had a hideous fiend in tow, a winged creature that was all eyeball and jagged teeth. Taken by curiosity, I crept as near as I dared..."
65,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MEDROD_000_062","...To see the corpse of a woman! One glimpse was enough to tell me that she'd died a gruesome death!"

69,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_IVAURAULT_000_065","Aye, anything to ensure that we won't have to suffer Medrod's hysteria ever again."
70,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MEDROD_000_066","All right, teamwork! That's what I wanted to—wait, I haven't been <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> bad, have I...? At any rate, I'm all for helping this adventurer. It's the least I can do to repay <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> for bringing me lentils and chestnuts!"
71,"TEXT_GAIUSA711_00784_MEDROD_000_070","Wh-What are you playing at!? If you're trying to <Color(-34022)>soothe</Color> me, you're going about it all wrong!"
