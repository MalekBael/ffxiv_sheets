1,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_SEQ_01","It is popularly believed that the local ziz may be responsible for the deaths. Aideen suggests that you cull six of the scalekin to see whether you can find any clues."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_SEQ_02","You have culled six ziz as suggested, and have little to show for it besides a rich crop of bites and gashes. Return to Fallgourd Float and report to Aideen."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_SEQ_03","Aideen strikes ziz from her list of suspects, and turns her attention once more towards the masked man and his winged eyeball."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_AIDEEN_000_001","Among the local fauna, only the scalekin known as ziz could inflict such wounds. That's why some folk are pointing the finger at them."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_AIDEEN_000_002","I somehow doubt that the answer's that simple, but for the sake of thoroughness, we should look into it. Why don't you put down, say, six of the creatures, and see if you can find any proof connecting them to the deaths?"

52,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_AIDEEN_000_020","You've already seen to the ziz? Good work, adventurer! So, were you able to find aught to suggest that the creatures are our culprits?"
53,"TEXT_GAIUSA801_00785_AIDEEN_000_021","...Nothing? Truth be told, even if there were proof, I wouldn't know what it looked like. Aaanyway, I believe we can safely strike ziz from our list of suspects. Which leaves us with...the masked man and his winged eyeball!"
