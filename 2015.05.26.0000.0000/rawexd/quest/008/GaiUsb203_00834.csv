1,"TEXT_GAIUSB203_00834_SEQ_01","Recent tremors off the shore of Costa del Sol have caused a troublesome influx of snippers. If that were not bad enough, Kuzai Tazai has informed you that the group is led by an even more fearsome creature. Providing you with a concoction that might be used to debilitate the larger foe, the Lalafell has bid you slay five of the snippers so that you might lure him out."

Nice to meet you! Even <Emphasis>more</Emphasis> so because I could use your help once again. It's those quakes that started up a little while ago. The tremors have been sending snippers up out of the water."
