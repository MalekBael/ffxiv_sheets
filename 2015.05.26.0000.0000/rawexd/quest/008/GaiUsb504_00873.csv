49,"TEXT_GAIUSB504_00873_ILIUD_000_001","Nowhere is the rule of privation so apparent as in Lost Hope. A man may die upon the roadside there and go unclaimed, for no ties bind these unhappy folk together except a common misfortune: their homelands are no more."

57,"TEXT_GAIUSB504_00873_ZAZAWAKA_000_041","I confess, though, I wonder if we are saved from a plague only to perish in war. We have little love for Garlemald here, and news of them who burned our homes travels fast."
