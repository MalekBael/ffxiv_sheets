1,"TEXT_GAIUSB712_00907_SEQ_01","Overhearing your conversation with Isaudorel, Ireine bids you take Coerthas's Ixal problem up the chain of command. Leave Ireine and Isaudorel to hurl comradely abuse at one another and make your report to Miah Molkot at Eugenia's Spire."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB712_00907_SEQ_02","Miah Molkot accepts Belmont's request without demur and with much purr. You learn that the White Rams are in fact a counter-Ixal levy, and on a personal level, Molkot appears to take nearly gustatory delight in defeating the birdmen. "

49,"TEXT_GAIUSB712_00907_IREINE_000_001","So, the matter you were speaking to Isaudorel about. I'm certain Instructor Molkot will be keen to hear of the Ixal's movements in the west─best you talk to her straightaway and make plans."

I can already hear their little necks breaking..."
