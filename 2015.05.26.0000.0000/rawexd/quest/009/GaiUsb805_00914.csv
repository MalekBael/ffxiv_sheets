2,"TEXT_GAIUSB805_00914_SEQ_02","After a long search and an unsettling encounter, you have found three of the four beads. Keep the whereabouts of the fourth to yourself, for closed lips are a virtue in Ishgard, and deliver the beads to Juline."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB805_00914_SEQ_03","Seemingly at peace in the calm waters between knowing and unknowing, Juline speaks of her lost love with a quiet grace that shames the sound and fury of the inquisition. How fragile life is in Ishgard, that a single accusation can end it all..."

62,"TEXT_GAIUSB805_00914_JULINE_000_027","I sought to mislay all memory of him, but he was my great friend as well as my betrothed. A lady of Ishgard does not deny a friend, even if the ways of the world would have us deny our own fathers and husbands. And so I shall never forget Matigniant."
