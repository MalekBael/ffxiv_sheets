1,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_SEQ_01","Ser Joellaut, the injured knight currently recuperating in the infirmary, previously told you of the night when Inquisitor Guillaime first arrived. When you relayed this account to Alphinaud, he found several questionable details which he cannot reconcile. He asks that you retrace the path the inquisitor is said to have taken that night, and see if it sheds any light on this mystery."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_SEQ_02","Your investigation leads you to a frozen corpse in the chasm which bears a striking resemblance to Inquisitor Guillaime. If you inspect the body, perhaps you will find some clue to his identity."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_SEQ_03","You find a bloody encyclical on the corpse which suggests that the man was a newly appointed inquisitor. Present the document to Alphinaud and see what he makes of it."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_SEQ_04","Alphinaud declares that your discoveries prove that the Inquisitor Guillaime you know is an impostor. However, his true identity and objectives remain unknown."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_ALPHINAUD_000_001","Since we've arrived in Whitebrim Front, I've seen no travelers arrive by the eastern gate. Moreover, he said he glimpsed a “silhouette illuminated by the light of the city,” which would imply that the inquisitor came from <Emphasis>north</Emphasis> of the eastern gate, not south.
But it cannot be so─that way lies naught but a deep chasm."

56,"TEXT_GAIUSC002_00939_ALPHINAUD_000_033","Still, while this is incontrovertible proof that the inquisitor is an impostor, we have yet to discern his true identity, or why he has decided to oppose us."
