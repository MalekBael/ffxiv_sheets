1,"TEXT_GAIUSC506_00994_SEQ_01","Obsessed with the lesser moon since it fell to earth five years ago, Klynthota found, then lost, a fragment of the hammer of the Calamity in the Singing Shards. Lurk there and ambush the elder hapalit with a pepper bomb, and thus regain the fragment."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC506_00994_SEQ_02","The bomb proved even more effective than you had hoped, and the fragment is yours. It is an odd thing to hold a piece of the moon in your hands, and an ill one at that. It would be best to pass it on to Klynthota as soon as possible."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC506_00994_SEQ_03","Overjoyed at her specimen's return, Klynthota reveals a startling find─that Dalamud was made of the same curious material as those abundantly found in Allagan artifacts. If she is not mistaken, the implications are dizzying..."
