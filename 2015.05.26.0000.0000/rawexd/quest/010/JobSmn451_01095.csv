49,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_041","Remember: we can only proceed with the next summoning ritual once you have grounded Garuda and captured her aetheric essence."
50,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_SYSTEM_000_042","The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon the successful defeat of the primal Garuda."
51,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_000","I sense Garuda's restless essence railing within the confines of your aetheric channels. It is time we granted it release with the Austerities of Wind."
52,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_001","Thankfully, I already have in mind a location that well suits our elemental purposes."
53,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_002","You are familiar with the Floating City of Nym in outer La Noscea? As you might imagine, the aspect of wind is entirely dominant in the area of those suspended isles."
54,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_003","Pray make your way there as soon as you feel prepared─I am quite excited to see this new egi!"
55,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_010","Shall we begin? I assume that as this is your third such experience, you have by now grown familiar with the steps of the ritual."
56,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_011","Thus, as before, I would have you concentrate on shifting your aetheric balance. Imagine the energy within you howling through your veins─an incessant gale of screeching wrath."
57,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_012","Garuda's essence will be only too eager to harness those raging currents, and shape them into a worldly avatar. Once Garuda-Egi has appeared, it falls to you to tame its fury."
58,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_020","Masterfully done, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Garuda-Egi's power is now yours to wield!"
59,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_021","Your aptitude for the art of summoning has exceeded my highest expectations. I honestly could not have found a more valuable partner for my research!"
60,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_022","Let us return to Apkallu Falls. I am sure you must be exhausted after this ordeal."
61,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_030","With the addition of Garuda-Egi, you now command three powerful avatars."
62,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_031","As you have no doubt realized, however, each of these entities has a particular role in which it excels."
63,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_032","For Garuda-Egi, that role is unleashing magic to strike down distant foes. I must admit to feeling equal parts joy and apprehension at how faithfully the summoned being displays the original primal's volatile disposition."
64,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_033","Experiment with your egi allies, and the most effective use of their individual abilities will soon become clear. With such mastery of the art at your disposal, I shall almost pity Tristan when next he chooses to confront you."
65,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_YMHITRA_000_034","Before that time comes, however, I will endeavor to pierce the mystery of his motivations. May your discoveries bring you new confidence, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>."
66,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_SYSTEM_000_035","When you have the Soul of the Summoner equipped, casting the spell <Color(-34022)>Summon</Color> will now call upon Garuda-Egi instead of Emerald Carbuncle."
67,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_QIB_001_TODO_1","Defeat Garuda-Egi!"
68,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_QIB_001_YMHITRA_BATTLETALK_01","Such powerful winds!
There can be no doubt we face Garuda's spawn!"
69,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_QIB_001_YMHITRA_BATTLETALK_02","Beware the avatar's feathers!"
70,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_QIB_001_YMHITRA_BATTLETALK_03","Do my eyes deceive me!?
I am certain you summoned but one egi!"
71,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_QIB_001_YMHITRA_BATTLETALK_04","I feel so battered and bruised...
It is past time we calmed this storm!"
72,"TEXT_JOBSMN451_01095_QIB_001_YMHITRA_BATTLETALK_DEAD","I thought...I thought myself ready..."
