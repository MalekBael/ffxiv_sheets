51,"TEXT_GAIUSE108_01182_SLAFBORN_000_003","I am told there are many such stones in the ruins at Qarn─the Sunken Temple. More than a few temple raiders have been foiled by their magicks, no doubt."

64,"TEXT_GAIUSE108_01182_SLAFBORN_000_042","One thing's for certain: that temple managed to stymie more explorers than ordinary dangers can account for. If any of that can be attributed to this stone, then it's Garleans and beastmen who'll have to settle their accounts with the gods!"
