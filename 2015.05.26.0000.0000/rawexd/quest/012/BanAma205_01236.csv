1,"TEXT_BANAMA205_01236_SEQ_01","Narujj Boh wishes to convince the U tribe rangers to quit the sands before their divided forces fall prey to Flamefang raiders. Speak with the drake whisperer in the Sagolii Desert to borrow a flame-spitting mount with which to cow the stubborn hunters."

※Speak with the drake whisperer in the Sagolii Desert to mount a cavalry drake."

4,"TEXT_BANAMA205_01236_SEQ_04","Narujj Boh praises your efforts in saving the Miqo'te rangers from their own ill-considered tactics. Though unconvinced that his plan will have any lasting effect, the stoic soldier is nevertheless content to deprive the Flamefangs of further tempered slaves for as long as possible."
