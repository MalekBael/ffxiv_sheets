1,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_SEQ_01","After educating you on the Amalj'aa's distaste for water, Narujj Boh asks that you subject the Brotherhood's foes to a humiliating defeat. Subdue the Flamefang ravagers you encounter in the south of Zanr'ak, and douse them with water from the heavy glass flasks at the moment of your victory."
2,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_SEQ_02","You have thoroughly soaked a number of defeated Flamefangs. Return to the Ring of Ash and report to Narujj Boh."
3,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_SEQ_03","Narujj Boh appears almost jovial at the news of your success. Though unable to witness the dousing firsthand, the warriors of the Brotherhood are much heartened by reports of the Flamefangs' defeat and subsequent humiliation."

49,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_001","Simple water. As a people with an affinity for flame, we require very little of the liquid compared to other races. In fact, ingesting too much water can be as deadly to us as imbibing poison."
50,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_002","Among the Amalj'aa, any who drinks water in excess is considered a fool. And, in the same vein, dousing an opponent with the substance constitutes the gravest form of humiliation. Have you perhaps divined my intent?"
51,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_003","I mean to subject the Flamefangs to the most crushing manner of defeat! Their flickering spirit for battle will not withstand the insult you shall deliver!"

58,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_020","You seem surprised, honored ally. Did the intensity of their reactions surprise you? You may as well have soaked them with burning oil, such was their shame!"
59,"TEXT_BANAMA207_01238_NARUJIBOH_000_021","The mood of our camp is much lightened thanks to your deeds. Though we could not witness their defeat directly, such victories do much to improve morale!"
