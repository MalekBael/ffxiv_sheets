49,"TEXT_BANAMA209_01240_NARUJIBOH_000_001","Our scout reports that the single ambusher appeared more interested in the trader's cargo─a number of boxes that drew our addled kin's undivided attention. I strongly suspect that only a haul of crystals would outweigh the value of a potential tempered slave."
50,"TEXT_BANAMA209_01240_NARUJIBOH_000_002","If this is true, then we cannot allow the contents of those boxes to reach the Zahar'ak Amalj'aa and their summoning rituals! ...And considering the circumstances of his misfortune, I think it best that you be the one to approach this trader and confirm my suspicions."
