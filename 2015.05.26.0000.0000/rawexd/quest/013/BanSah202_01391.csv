1,"TEXT_BANSAH202_01391_SEQ_01","The Coral Tridents have established a breeding program for elbst, but there is only one stud animal. Instinct being what it is, anyone slaying a couple of young Sapsa elbst should find <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> in the company of the irate sire. With this knowledge in the back of your mind, proceed into Trident territory and start dispatching elbst. When the sire arrives, use the milky vitriol given to you against the steely skinned creature and lay it low."
2,"TEXT_BANSAH202_01391_SEQ_02","You have made a burial ground of Sapsa today, with both the sire and the young dead by your hands. Console yourself that the sea and the shore are safer for it, and report your success to Houu."
3,"TEXT_BANSAH202_01391_SEQ_03","Houu has no doubt that your actions have saved lives─certainly in Novv's Nursery, and perhaps among the Tridents as well, though they seem to offer their lives willingly in the cause of ultimate ascendancy. Things are definitely not better under this sea, and there may be calls on your service again."
