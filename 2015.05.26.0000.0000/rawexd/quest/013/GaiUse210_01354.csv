1,"TEXT_GAIUSE210_01354_SEQ_01","Minfilia suddenly recalls that she asked her mother to arrange a welcome supper for the first arrivals. Observing that you are unoccupied at present, she bids you ask F'lhaminn if there is aught which needs doing."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE210_01354_SEQ_02","F'lhaminn informs you that the Seventh Heaven is responsible for preparing the meals, and that all should be proceeding according to plan. However, it would seem she too is a proponent of excess caution. You are to speak with Alys to confirm the state of the meals─but not before collecting several bottles of wine which are to be delivered as well."

Regardless of the circumstances which led to your arrival, she is nonetheless grateful for your presence, as there is a situation which would benefit from your personal attention."
