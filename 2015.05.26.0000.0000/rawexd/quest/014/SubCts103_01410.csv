49,"TEXT_SUBCTS103_01410_HUGUBERT_000_001","Eastern Thanalan's lovely this time of the year. You've heard of the training grounds at Halatali, I'll wager. The place fell into...disuse after the Calamity, but some adventurer or another put it to rights."

54,"TEXT_SUBCTS103_01410_ARLH_000_002","Now, I'll wager he didn't put two and two together when he heard your name. You're the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If> Fafajoni over there was talking about, aren't you?"
