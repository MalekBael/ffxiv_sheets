1,"TEXT_SUBCTS808_01423_SEQ_01","The sharp-eyed Guiding Star correctly determines that you are a person with skilled hands, and asks to see your tool of choice. While such a request would usually offend your sense of propriety, so earnest is he that you decide to speak with him again after equipping your gatherer's or crafter's primary tool (item level 50 and higher)."
2,"TEXT_SUBCTS808_01423_SEQ_02","Guiding Star beheld your tool with all the decorum and delicacy called for by the occasion. Judging you to be both sufficiently adept and inadequately equipped, he introduces you to the toolsmith Talan. Deal with this surly smith and surely you will profit by it, in equipage and ability both."
