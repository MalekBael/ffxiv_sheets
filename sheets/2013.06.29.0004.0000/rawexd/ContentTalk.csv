1,1,"Fall in and make ready!"
2,2,"At ease, adventurer. All your allies have yet to arrive."
3,3,"The operation will begin when your party is complete."

20,4,"Well met! I've been dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild to recruit volunteers for special small-scale operations known as guildhests. You look to be of sound mind and body. Might you consider joining?"
21,4,"Wait... Might this be your first time participating in a guildhest? I remember my first hest. It was the night of my twentieth nameday. My fellow guildmates invited me to join them in the slaying of a family of peistes who were stealing chocobo eggs from Bentbranch Meadows."
22,4,"The moment we arrived, one of the terrible beasts immediately turned to me and charged. The thing was thrice my size and had already maimed several chocobokeeps."
23,4,"There was no way I could win, so I simply froze and waited for the end. But that's when I remembered that I was not alone. My friends rallied around me, and together we defeated the peistes! That, my friend, is what a guildhest is truly about."
24,4,"Well met! I've been dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild to recruit volunteers for special small-scale operations known as guildhests."
25,4,"These operations will pit those volunteers against deadly foes, and the odds won't always be in their favor. This is why we require all participants to be of sound mind and body─something that you do not yet appear to be."
26,4,"Time is of the essence. If you have something to ask, make it quick."
27,4,"The operation was a success! Here's your reward, and don't let anyone tell you that you didn't earn it."
28,4,"The operation was a success! Here's your payment, and for your efforts, I've thrown in a little extra, so that you may consider returning to aid us once again."
29,4,"Well, well. It looks like you have a full bag."
30,4,"Can't you see I'm busy attending to your allies? I don't have time to chat."
40,4,"Greetings, adventurer. I am a battlewarden dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild and tasked with recruiting volunteers to participate in operations known by the quaint moniker, “guildhest.”"
41,4,"As this appears to be your first time joining us, allow me a moment to explain in detail just what exactly a guildhest entails."
42,4,"More than a simple levequest, but not quite as realm-shaking as a Grand Company outing, guildhests will test your ability to work together with a small party of battle companions to overcome no-so-small obstacles."
43,4,"The duty is taxing, but the coin is decent, and you will be helping maintain the safety of Eorzea and the well-being of her citizens. So, what say you?"
44,4,"Greetings, adventurer. I am a battlewarden dispatched by the Adventurers' Guild and tasked with recruiting volunteers to participate in operations known by the quaint moniker, “guildhest.”"
45,4,"I can tell by your garb and gait that the tasks I offer are far beyond a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> of your means. Might I suggest you return once you have honed your skills in the martial or magical arts."
46,4,"Quickly, adventurer. Every moment spent chatting with me is a moment squandered."
47,4,"Excellent work! Ah, but I suppose you will be wanting your reward now. Very good, then. You have more than earned it."
48,4,"A solid performance. You seem to know your way around the battlefield. Here is to hoping that I may work with you again at a later time."
49,4,"Your bag appears to be quite full. You should consider hiring a retainer."
50,4,"I am attending to your allies at the moment. I will see to you when I have finished."
60,4,"Battlewarden Chiroro Chiro, at your service....or should I say, you'll be at <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> service if you agree to join one of our guildhests."
61,4,"What's a guildhest? Why, it's a be<Emphasis>hest</Emphasis> issued by the Adventurers' <Emphasis>Guild</Emphasis>, savvy? When a certain task brought to the attention of the guild is a little to grand for a leve, but not grand enough for Grand Company involvement, they're deemed guildhests and sent to yours truly."
62,4,"But don't let the lack of grandeur fool you. The tasks are anythin' but simple. Most take place in tight quarters, and <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> require precision teamwork 'twixt you and your battlemates."
63,4,"And so what do you get in return for placing your neck on the loppin' block? Besides a beamin' grin from battlewarden Chiroro Chiro? Fame, fortune, the usual."
64,4,"Battlewarden Chiroro Chiro, at your service....or should I say, you'll be at <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> service if you agree to join one of our guildhests."
65,4,"But now that I take a closer look at you, I don't reckon you'll be at <Emphasis>anyone's</Emphasis> service 'til you've bloodied your hands a bit more."
66,4,"I can't think of a single reason why you should be over <Emphasis>here</Emphasis> when the things what need guttin' sit over <Emphasis>there</Emphasis>. Unless that is, you're fixin' to bolt."
67,4,"Bloody hells, that was brilliant! I never tire watchin' me a good broil, especially when it's down and dirty. Here's your coin, just a as promised."
68,4,"Hah hah hah! A fine display for a first-timer. Here's your well-earned coin. I've tossed in a little somethin' extra to sweeten the deal, so's that you might consider comin' back."
69,4,"I cannot well fit your reward into that pack. She's burstin' at the seams!"
70,4,"Wait the queue with the rest o' your battlemates, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. There's only one of me, despite the demand."
80,4,"Shkoh! Shkoh! Gobbieflock in danger! Uplanders take gatekey! Open Headgate!"
81,4,"Twist gatekey! Open Headgate with much fastness!"
