Use ranged attacks to lure single targets from the pack without the massive seedkin noticing.","This battle exercise will test your ability to manage multiple parties of enemies.

2,111001,14742,"Defeat Bockman and his hells-spawned minions!","As Bockman sustains damage, he will summon ashkin to fight at his side. Those tasked with the protection of the party (gladiators, paladins, etc.) should focus on directing enmity away from their companions.","The more enemies there are on the battlefield, the higher the chance for party casualties. Those who excel in dealing damage (archers, pugilists, etc.) should focus on taking out the ashkin as soon as they appear.","Bockman, a wandering revenant trapped in the corporeal realm, has reclaimed his legendary suit of armor and now waits silently near the Tam–Tara Deepcroft for any who would challenge him. Not only does the undead knight brandish a massive blade capable of incapacitating multiple victims in one fell stroke, but when threatened, Bockman will summon his decaying minions from the pits of the seventh hell.

Finish off the ledgeleaper before the vilekin can join the fray.","This battle exercise will test your ability to breach enemy stronghold defenses.

Eliminate targets in each of the three antechambers before infiltrating the final chamber and engaging the cyclopean toad who makes the cave its den.

Try and keep the creature beyond the reach of their spells.","Slay fire sprites and use their cores to light the herb patch on fire, releasing a sleep-inducing smoke which will calm the gil turtle, making the creature easier to capture.","Wealthy noble, Teledji Adeledji, has had his prized pet, a rare gil turtle, kidnapped by ruthless bandits who seek a sizable ransom for the gentle wavekin's return. Always a man of principle, Teledji Adeledji has decided that instead of caving to the bandit's demands, he will offer the ransom to anyone who can safely retrieve his pet from the clutches of evil.

After weakening the gil turtle, slay fire sprites and use their cores to light a special herb on fire. The smoke released should be powerful enough to put the creature to sleep, but only if the turtle is close enough to the flames.",10420,1850,2360,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False

Try to defeat the outlaws in pairs or small groups instead of engaging the whole band at once.","Redbelly chanters are skilled in the art of conjury, and will tend to the wounds of their injured companions. Focus your efforts on ridding the Redbelly ranks of these members to ensure the operation ends quickly.","A notorious band of outlaws known as the Redbelly Wasps is seeking to establish a new hideout near the Thousand Maws of Toto–Rak.

Once the leader is attacked, he will summon nearby allies to his aid, including powerful conjurers skilled in the arts of healing. Defeating these allies before engaging their leader will greatly increase your chance of success.",12590,2230,3100,130,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,False

Temporarily enhanced by the spells, these turned creatures now possess the ability to enfeeble their victims with terrible poisons and wide-reaching attacks.

Avoid extinguishing flames while the fiend is near party members.","A terrible creature calling itself Buso has made a nearby mineshaft his new home away from the void. Slay the fiend before he can do whatever it is he came from the dark reaches of the outerworld to do.

Buso draws his power from eerie blue flames which erupt from the carcasses of minions summoned from the void and then sacrificed here in this realm.
