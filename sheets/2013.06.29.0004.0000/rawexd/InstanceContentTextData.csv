1409,"What in the seven hells are you fools doing!? Fall back and regroup!"

1702,"Your orders are to capture the gil turtle. The best manner in which to accomplish this task is by first weakening the poor creature."
1703,"The craven bandits who spirited away the turtle would not have you reclaim their prize, and will heal the creature's wounds with hopes that their efforts will discourage you into leaving. Draw the turtle away from the conjurers."
1704,"In its current weakened state, the gil turtle will be unable to resist the effects of the herbs. Now quickly! We require fire sprite cores!"
1705,"Use the core to light the herb patch lying be fore me."
1706,"The herbs are aflame! Now do what you must to draw the gil turtle into the smoke!"
1707,"And so the gentle giant succumbs to slumber's blissful embrace. Our work here is complete."
1708,"Those efts may prove troublesome if left alone. Slay the wavekin before the situation becomes problematic."
1709,"Out of cores? Well then claim new ones! You'd think that much was obvious!"
1710,"Stay your blades! The client specifically stated that he wished his pet returned alive!"

1803,"Do not let down your guard. The battle has only just begun."
1804,"It may take some coercing to draw that one from the mist."
1805,"Leave the mist at once! You will need all your strength to defeat these horrors of the wood!"
1806,"Maneuver clear of the raining pollen clusters lest you find yourself caught in their mist!"

1908,"Their conjurers will spell your end. Silence the casters so that there are none who might heal the swarmpoint."
1909,"Keep your eyes open for roaming bandits who will join the fray! Remember this when situating your battles."
1910,"Without their conjurers to heal them, you should make quick work of the others."
1911,"The swarmpoint is known for his unmatchable strength. Send your hardiest allies to bear the brunt of his might while the others slowly drain his vitality."
1912,"Reinforcements! See to the conjurers before your efforts are rendered to naught."
1913,"Another unit! You know what you must do!"
1914,"Not all their spellweavers are masters of the curative arts. Learn to distinguish the healers from the rest!"

2000,"Use the guild-issue items to your advantage."

2003,"Reinforcements remaining: "
2004,"Beware! The foul poisons of these creatures will disrupt your humours and send your body into fits."
2005,"Do not let the poisons overwhelm you! Use the time between battles to purge the toxins from your veins."
2006,"Confirm that each of your allies knows his role. One misstep could mean a man poisoned, paralyzed...or worse!"
2007,"Use the spell Esuna to your advantage! And if that fails you, a good old antidote will often do the trick."
2008,"Without an ally to draw his magicks away from the others, Briaxio will unleash his bane on all of you!"
2009,"Briaxio's followers have rushed to his aid! Send several of your allies to drive off the reinforcements while those remaining keep Briaxio under control."
2100,"Destroy the goblins' makeshift barricades and continue up the Matron's Lethe."
2101,"Avoid Stikflix Grumblytoss's bombs."
2102,"The goblins hide behind their barricades. You must destroy these obstacles to reach them. However, be always aware of their bombs."
2103,"The bombs wielded by Stikflix Grumblytoss are much deadlier and have a greater blast radius than those used by his rag-tag army."
2104,"Remember your roles within the party and communicate with your allies. Those are the keys to victory!"
2105,"If a bomb is tossed your way, do not panic. Simply retreat until it detonates and then return to the frontlines."
2106,"I shall give the goblins credit where credit is due. It must have taken them a half turn of the sun to drag these crates into place... Now demolish them!"
2107,"The first station is toppled, but another lies near the top of the heavenspillar. Forward, adventurers!"
2108,"Now all who remains is the goblins' leader, Stikflix Grumblytoss! Give him no quarter!"
2109,"Stikflix Grumblytoss may not appear to be the most formidable of foes, but his realm-shaking explosives make him a force to be reckoned with. If one happens to land in your vicinity, you would take my advice and run."

2200,"Rotten jam will emerge from the stale bubbles if ignored. Burst them before they burst on their own."
2201,"When burst, acid bubbles will emit a harmful, corrosive liquid. Avoid attacking them at all costs!"
2202,"Rotten jam! That's why I warned you to burst the stale bubbles. Now you have that <Emphasis>thing</Emphasis> to deal with!"
2203,"That wasn't so hard now, was it?"
2204,"What did the damn morbol do, pass wind!? See to the bubbles afore they see to you!"
2205,"I reckon you've done this before. That was some proper combat, if I do say so meself."
2206,"What are you fixing to do? Get us all killed?"
2207,"Not another! Just the smell alone is enough to make a man retch! Do away with the thing, would you?"
2208,"The stale bubbles, not the acid bubbles, you mud-brained dullard!"
2209,"Send the damned thing back to the hell it slithered up from!"
2210,"Good eyes, adventurers! Good eyes!"
2211,"Not the most pleasant buggers to fight, are they? Maybe next time you'll heed me words and burst the bubbles first."
2212,"See the bastard's vines start to twitch? The creature grows weak!"
2213,"Leave them stale bubbles be, and from them'll drop a dollop of rancid ooze almost as foul as me ma's gruel. If you don't want to see that happen, burst the bubbles quick."
2300,"Buso draws his strength from the blue flames. Extinguish the flames to make him more susceptible to your attacks."
2301,"A new blue flame will appear where <SheetEn(BNpcName,1,IntegerParameter(1),1,1)/> is slain. Choose your battles."
2302,"If you are branded with Buso's Mark of Pain, distance yourself from your allies so that they are not caught in the Dark Dome."
2303,"Those horrible blue flames─they're the aetherial traces of slain voidsent. Our Lifestream won't have the stuff, so the essence remains trapped in the corporeal realm. Buso taps that essence..."
2304,"You cannot slay a void hound without it leaving behind a flame. If you are to cull the beasts, be ready to deal swiftly with the consequences of your actions."
2305,"Buso readies the Mark of Pain! Once marked, you cannot escape the fate you are dealt...but you can spare your allies!"
2306,"Go! Smother the blue flames! It's the only way to see Buso weakened!"
2307,"Damn! Another blue flame is lit! Buso grows stronger every moment he basks in its unholy light!"
2308,"Rise up, adventurer! This battle is not yet lost! Remember the blue flames!"
2309,"Only one flame remains! Quickly! See it out!"
2310,"Now is your chance! Tear the fiend limb from limb...from limb from limb!"
