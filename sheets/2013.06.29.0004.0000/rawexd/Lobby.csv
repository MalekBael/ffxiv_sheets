blades, from daggers to longswords, be they single- or double-edged,

on diverse combat tactics, training its members to bring their martial
skills to bear in any situation. As such, there are practitioners who
marry sword with shield, seeking to defend their fellow companions.
Others opt for an empty off hand, choosing instead to focus entirely

ancient cliffs worn by the relentless onslaught of the Rhotano Sea,
lies the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa. Its economy is driven
primarily by shipping, but boasts lucrative shipbuilding, fishing, and
smithing industries as well. To maintain the safety of its maritime
routes, the city employs a formidable navy known as the Knights
of the Barracuda. Even so, pirate bands run rampant in nearby waters,
reaving and pillaging."
1981,0,0,0,"Gridania","","In the eastern reaches of the Aldenard landmass, home to vast, dense
woodlands and coursing rivers, lies the forest nation of Gridania. The
cityscape is a mosaic of labyrinthine waterways and great wooden
structures, so gracefully constructed they seem a part of the
surrounding environment. The favored goddess of the citizenry is
Nophica, the Matron, but great faith is also placed in the wisdom of
the Seedseers－young oracles who guide the nation based on the
will of the forest's elementals."
1982,0,0,0,"Ul'dah","","The bustling commercial hub of Ul'dah sits amid the desolate desert
landscape of southern Aldenard. Ul'dahn culture is known for its
affluence, and the wealth of the nation comes in large part from its
abundant mineral resources and clothcrafting industry. Though it is
the sultana who claims sovereignty, true power is wielded by the
Syndicate, a council sat by six of Ul'dah's most elite and influential.
Nald'thal is the nation's patron deity, and two great halls devoted to
His two aspects lie in the east and west of the city."
