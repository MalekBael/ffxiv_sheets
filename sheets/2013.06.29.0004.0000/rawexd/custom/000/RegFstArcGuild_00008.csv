1,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_Q1_000_1","What will you ask?"
2,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_A1_000_1","What do you do here?"
3,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_A1_000_2","What is archery?"
4,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_A1_000_3","Nothing."
5,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_2","I am the master of this guild, appointed to my post by Bowlord Lewin of the Gods' Quiver."
6,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_3","Amongst my many duties, it is my privilege to oversee the training of those who would master the bow. I also provide such aid to the townsfolk as I am able, lending an ear to their woes and dispatching archers to put down unruly fauna."
7,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_4","Here at the guild, we seek to instill a discerning eye within our members, that they might learn to strike at vulnerabilities, swiftly and surely."
8,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_5","Our art can be likened to the pursuit of truth...though mayhap that likeness is lost upon you. If you take up the bow, you will come to comprehend the meaning of these words."
9,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_6","The bow's greatest advantage is its range. Unlike those arms used in other disciplines of war, it allows one to strike at the enemy from afar."
10,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_7","Though the bow may not boast the destructive force of a sword or spear, its myriad strategic applications more than compensate for this shortcoming. An experienced archer can immobilize an enemy by striking a leg, or sap its strength with a poisoned arrow."
11,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_8","Rise to become a virtuoso of archery, and a veritable deluge of death will be yours to rain down upon your foes."
12,"TEXT_REGFSTARCGUILD_00008_LUCIANE_000_9","By fighting from a distance, we can better assess the battlefield and thereby determine the most advantageous course of action. This is of paramount import, as our role in battle is to exploit the enemy's weakness. With the requisite placement and timing, but a single arrow may serve to turn the tide."
