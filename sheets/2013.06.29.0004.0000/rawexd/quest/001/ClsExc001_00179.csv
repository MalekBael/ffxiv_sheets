48,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_0","Ho there, adventurer. Curious about the Marauders' Guild, are ye?"
49,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_1","Any axe worth wieldin' needs two hands on the haft an' has a blade what can chop clean through a galley's mast. That's the kind o' weapon our members train to use with deceptive swiftness an' brutal force."
50,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_2","If yer of a mind to make the marauder's art yer life's work, then our guild welcomes ye with open arms. What say ye, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>? Keen to join the ranks?"
51,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_Q1_000_1","Do you wish to join the Marauders' Guild?"
52,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_A1_000_1","Yes"
53,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_A1_000_2","No"
54,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_8","Ye've got the right kind o' fire in yer belly, I'll give ye that. But yer still a bit wet behind the ears, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Come back when ye've had chance to plant yer feet firmly as an adventurer, then we'll talk axes."
55,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_SYSTEM_000_9","Before you can take up another discipline, you must first complete the level 10 quest of your starting class."
56,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_11","Well then, here's a bit o' guild history so ye know what yer gettin' into. It all started with ships, ye see. What's that got to do with axes? Well, ye won't be makin' many sea vessels without a sturdy tool to lop down trees for the lumber."
57,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_12","An' since only the Navigator Herself knows when a ship'll run afoul of a storm or worse, it makes sense for the crew's carpenter to carry an axe on board. But any tool on a ship can become a weapon─an' the axe is perfect for hookin' yerself over the rail of an enemy vessel, lettin' loose in a whirl o' steel, an' generally layin' waste to all about ye."
58,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_13","As more seafarers took up the axe as their weapon o' choice, so did the savage art o' the marauder begin to take shape─especially among the pirates where strength an' skill decided yer place in the world."
59,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_15","With an eye to assemblin' crews o' battle-ready raiders, the pirates started teachin' the proper way to wield a choppin' blade to their new recruits. An' that's how the Marauders' Guild first sprung into bein'."
60,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_17","After the Galadion Accord was signed, though, the Marauders' Guild was never the same─it was taken over, restructured, an' purged of its pirate roots. It had been reborn as an institution dedicated to naught but the teachin' of axe fightin'."
61,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_18","The members o' this new Marauders' Guild weren't no greed-driven cutthroats neither, but warriors what sought to contribute to society with martial prowess."
62,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_19","Still keen, are ye? Think it over, then let me know if ye decide to join our ranks."
63,"TEXT_CLSEXC001_00179_BLAUTHOTA_000_5","That's yer choice, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>─the axe ain't for everyone. May the Navigator guide ye on whichever path ye decide to set yer feet on."
