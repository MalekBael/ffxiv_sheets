49,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_2","First, let's see you make three leather chokers."
50,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_3","After all, there's more to our craft than simply tanning hides, and chokers are just about the simplest things one can make."
51,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_4","You'll need circles of leather and animal sinew to accomplish this task. Osgyth can provide the sinew, and I'm sure you recall the method for making leather."
52,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_5","I hope your technique has improved since last time."
53,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_6","Now, while we have an ample stock of skins, there are other means of procuring your materials."
54,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_7","Hunting for your own pelts, for instance. Aye, I know what I said about that before. But that was about assuming it was <Emphasis>necessary</Emphasis>. <Emphasis>Choosing</Emphasis> to do so is another matter. Indeed, it may teach you to appreciate the source of your livelihood."
55,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_8","Not all leatherworkers are wont to choose this method...but you are an adventurer, are you not?"
56,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_9","When you've finished your work, bring your chokers here for inspection."
57,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_20","You've finished your work, then?"
58,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_21","I suppose there is no denying that these are leather chokers."
59,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_22","If truth be told, an opo–opo could've achieved similar results given skins, sinew, and time."
60,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_23","Oh, but I don't mean to make light of your efforts. You fulfilled the order precisely as requested─a job well done."
61,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_24","Now then, I will teach you something to supplement your learning."
62,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_25","Through physical training, the body can be made strong and resistant to injury. Not so the throat, which ever remains a vulnerable point."
63,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_26","Although a leather choker provides less protection than a metal gorget, its simple design makes it ideal for everyday applications."
64,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_27","This simplicity also makes it an ideal choice for beginners practicing basic techniques─and for guildmasters assessing their progress."
65,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_28","As you are, you would make a passable leatherworker─one among the nameless multitudes who scrape a living out there. Whether you rise to become something more is contingent upon your efforts."
66,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_29","Consider this recruit's awl a reward for your efforts."
67,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_30","You will find it an indispensable partner to the head knife as you continue your training."
68,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_31","Now, I must return to my work. If you chance to find me unoccupied again, mayhap I will teach you something else."
69,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_GEVA_000_32","Till then, keep your nose to the grindstone!"

71,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_SYSTEM_000_41","A higher craftsmanship rating hastens the progress of synthesis; greater control increases the chance of creating high-quality items; and additional CP improves your crafting stamina."
72,"TEXT_CLSTAN001_00106_SYSTEM_000_42","Outfitting yourself with an eye to your current objective will increase the efficiency of your crafting endeavors."
