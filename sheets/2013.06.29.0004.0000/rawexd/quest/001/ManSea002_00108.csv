48,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_1","Right, then. Let's start ye off nice and easy with three tasks what'll 'elp ye settle into yer life 'ere in Limsa."
49,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_2","Firstly, if ye 'ead down a floor then point yer nose to the west, ye'll get an eyeful o' the great glowin' crystal in middle o' the courtyard."
50,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_3","That's an aetheryte─a device what moves ye from one place to another. When ye need to be somewhere in a bleedin' 'urry, there's no swifter way to travel."
51,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_4","'Ave a chat with the Yellowjacket on guard and ye'll be treated to a lecture on the workin's o' the device. Afore that though, ye should try slappin' yer mitts on the crystal itself."
52,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_5","Second on the list is the marketplace. Ye'll find weapons and armor and all yer 'venturin' bits and pieces for sale in the district what lies beyond the aetheryte."
53,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_6","There's more to the markets than just throwin' yer coin around, so be sure ye 'ave a word with Swozblaet, the 'ead o' the Merchants' League."
54,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_7","Give 'im this rusty old octant, and 'e'll know ye've come from me."
55,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_8","For the last o' me 'elpful 'ints, I suggest ye meet some fellow axe-wielders at the Marauders' Guild."
56,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_9","Ye'll be sure to learn a few new tricks fer swingin' that skull-chopper if ye decide to join their crew. Blauthota at the front desk is the one to get ye started."
57,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_10","Alright, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>? That ought to give ye a fair run about the city and show ye some o' the sights while yer at it."
58,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_11","Curse me, I almost forgot me most useful advice: there's no 'arm in stoppin' to listen to some poor sod's sob story."
59,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_12","Might be that it sounds more of a chore, but ye never know what interestin' tasks or tales are hidin' out there, just waitin' fer ye to crack open the lid."
60,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_13","Aye, ye'll likely be naught more'n an <If(PlayerParameter(4))>errand-girl<Else/>errand-boy</If> at the outset, but after ye build a reputation as people can trust, the jobs'll get 'arder and more rewardin'. That's the road to becomin' a truly grand adventurer."
61,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_20","Ah, another novice adventurer. Aye, I have seen more than a few of your type visiting the aetheryte at Baderon's instruction."
62,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_21","I am Sundhimal, one of the Yellowjackets assigned to keeping the peace in Limsa Lominsa. It is also my charge to provide guidance in the use of this device. Fear not; I shall be brief."
63,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_22","Aetherytes are crystalline structures that tap into aetherial energies, and are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another."
64,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_23","Return and Teleport─the most common transportation spells─make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether."
65,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_24","And as these devices are found in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer worthy of the name will wish to seek out and attune <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> to each one."
66,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_25","Once you have expanded your horizons beyond the walls of the city, you will soon find yourself performing the act of attunement as a matter of due course."
67,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_26","There is, however, no need for unseemly haste. You shall find that the aetherytes found in and around the city will be sufficient for the present."
68,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SUNDHIMAL_000_27","Should you wish to learn more about the aetheryte or transportation magic, I am here to answer your questions."
69,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SYSTEM_000_28","You attune with the aetheryte.
You are now able to use the Return spell!"
70,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_31","A fine <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>evening<Else/>morning</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>day<Else/>evening</If></If> to you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>!

71,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_32","Pray browse the stalls until your eyeballs ache from the abundance of unbelievable bargains! Now, as much as I would dearly love to further expound on the unrivaled quality of our merchandise, I must tend to a cargo but newly arrived at the docks─"
72,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_33","Hm? You bear to me a octant from the hands of Baderon himself? By the Navigator, I must have left it behind in the Wench, along with a week's pay and several bell's worth of intoxicated memories!"
73,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_34","I am most grateful to have it back! This tool is a keepsake from my days as a ship captain, you see. You shall have recompense, and what better coin to receive than the wisdom of a master merchant!"
74,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_35","If it is simple and sturdy adventuring equipment you seek, you needn't go further than the East and West arms of Hawkers' Alley."
75,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_36","Should you wish to prepare for battle, equipping oneself with the best arms and armor one can afford is always gil well spent."
76,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_37","Hawkers' Alley has myriad stalls that specialize in the tools of war and offer you your choice of quality weaponry or protective gear."
77,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_38","And within but a few steps are bazaars and apothecaries that will most amply supply all your potion and perishable needs."
78,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_39","Our keen-eyed agents procure a befuddling range of wares during their sojourns to distant shores, thus it pays to become familiar with the type─and price─of the goods stocked by each particular shop."
79,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_40","Such knowledge will serve you well if your purse is light or your time is short."
80,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_SWOZBLAET_000_41","Shall I continue with this verbal instruction? Nay, I say more value is to be gained by wandering the markets yourself. Experience, even when bitter, is the surest teacher!"
81,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_50","Ho there, adventurer. Curious about the Marauders' Guild, are ye?"
82,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_51","Any axe worth wieldin' needs two hands on the haft an' has a blade what can chop clean through a galley's mast. That's the kind o' weapon our members train to use with deceptive swiftness an' brutal force."
83,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_52","Are ye interested in hearin' more, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>? Then why don't I give ye the short version o' the guild's foundin' history an' we can go from there."
84,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_53","It all started with ships, ye see. What's that got to do with axes, ye ask? Well, ye won't be makin' many sea vessels without a sturdy tool to lop down trees for the lumber."
85,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_54","An' since only the Navigator Herself knows when a ship'll run afoul of a storm or worse, it makes sense for the crew's carpenter to carry an axe on board. Aye, it all started with shipbuildin' an' ship repair. What? Am I borin' ye?"
86,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_55","Well now, any tool on a ship can become a weapon. An' the axe was perfect for hookin' yerself over the rail of an enemy vessel, lettin' loose in a whirl o' steel, an' generally layin' waste to all about ye."
87,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_56","As more seafarers took up the axe as their weapon o' choice, so did the savage art o' the marauder begin to take shape─especially among the pirates where strength an' skill decided yer place in the world."
88,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_57","With an eye to assemblin' crews o' battle-ready raiders, the pirates started teachin' the proper way to wield a choppin' blade to their new recruits. This be how the Marauders' Guild first sprung into bein'."
89,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_58","But once the Galadion Accord was signed to unite the Maelstrom an' the pirates against Limsa Lominsa's enemies, the whole game changed."
90,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_59","The accord itself was a dismal failure o' course, but the Marauders' Guild was never the same─it was taken over, restructured, an' purged of its pirate roots. It had been reborn as an institution dedicated to naught but the teachin' of axe fightin'."
91,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_60","The members o' this new Marauders' Guild weren't no greed-driven cutthroats neither, but warriors what sought to contribute to society with martial prowess."
92,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_61","If masterin' the axe is yer heart's desire, then ye'll find no better arena in which to practice yer swings."
93,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BLAUTHOTA_000_62","Think it over, then let me know if ye decide to join our ranks. I've a feelin' I'll be seein' more o' ye soon, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>."
94,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_70","Ah, there ye are, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Ye back from yer jaunt around the city, then?"
95,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_71","If ye mean to base yerself in Limsa Lominsa, that won't be the last time ye'll visit them three places."
96,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_72","And now ye've got some idea o' which way's up, ye can start explorin' the rest o' the town."
97,"TEXT_MANSEA002_00108_BADERON_000_73","Ye've shown a good ear fer listenin', <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>. Ye stick with ol' Baderon, and we'll see how far we can take ye."
