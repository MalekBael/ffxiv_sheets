48,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_1","Right, then. Let's start ye off nice and easy with three tasks what'll 'elp ye settle into yer life 'ere in Limsa."
49,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_2","Firstly, if ye 'ead down a floor then point yer nose to the west, ye'll get an eyeful o' the great glowin' crystal in middle o' the courtyard."
50,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_3","That's an aetheryte─a device what moves ye from one place to another. When ye need to be somewhere in a bloody 'urry, there's no swifter way to travel."
51,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_4","'Ave a chat with the Yellowjacket on guard and ye'll be treated to a lecture on the workin's o' the device. Afore that though, ye should try slappin' yer mitts on the crystal itself."
52,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_5","Second on the list is the marketplace. Ye'll find weapons and armor and all yer 'venturin' bits and pieces for sale in the district what lies beyond the aetheryte."
53,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_6","There's more to the markets than just throwin' yer coin around, so be sure ye 'ave a word with Swozblaet, the 'ead o' the Merchants' League."
54,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_7","Give 'im this rusty old octant, and 'e'll know ye've come from me."
55,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_8","For the last o' me 'elpful 'ints, I suggest ye meet some fellow spell-slingers at the Arcanists' Guild."
56,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_9","Ye'll be sure to learn a few new tricks fer yer tome if ye decide to join their crew. Murie at the front desk is the one to get ye started."
57,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_10","Alright, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>lass<Else/>lad</If>? That ought to give ye a fair run about the city and show ye some o' the sights while yer at it."
58,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_11","Curse me, I almost forgot me most useful advice: there's no 'arm in stoppin' to listen to some poor sod's sob story."
59,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_12","Might be that it sounds more of a chore, but ye never know what interestin' tasks or tales are hidin' out there, just waitin' fer ye to crack open the lid."
60,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_BADERON_000_13","Aye, ye'll likely be naught more'n an <If(PlayerParameter(4))>errand-girl<Else/>errand-boy</If> at the outset, but after ye build a reputation as people can trust, the jobs'll get 'arder and more rewardin'. That's the road to becomin' a truly grand adventurer."
61,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_20","Ah, another novice adventurer. Aye, I have seen more than a few of your type visiting the aetheryte at Baderon's instruction."
62,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_21","I am Sundhimal, one of the Yellowjackets assigned to keeping the peace in Limsa Lominsa. It is also my charge to provide guidance in the use of this device. Fear not; I shall be brief."
63,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_22","Aetherytes are crystalline structures that tap into aetherial energies, and are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another."
64,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_23","Return and Teleport─the most common transportation spells─make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether."
65,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_24","And as these devices are found in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer worthy of the name will wish to seek out and attune <If(PlayerParameter(4))>herself<Else/>himself</If> to each one."
66,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_25","Once you have expanded your horizons beyond the walls of the city, you will soon find yourself performing the act of attunement as a matter of due course."
67,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_26","There is, however, no need for unseemly haste. You shall find that the aetherytes found in and around the city will be sufficient for the present."
68,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SUNDHIMAL_000_27","Should you wish to learn more about the aetheryte or transportation magic, I am here to answer your questions."
69,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SYSTEM_000_28","You attune with the aetheryte.
You are now able to use the Return spell!"
70,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_31","A fine <If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),12))><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),4))>evening<Else/>morning</If><Else/><If(LessThan(PlayerParameter(11),17))>day<Else/>evening</If></If> to you, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>madam<Else/>sir</If>! Welcome to the most replete marketplace in the grand realm of Eorzea, where our shelves are fit to bursting with practical goods and wondrous treasures from across the seven seas!"
71,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_32","Pray browse the stalls until your eyeballs ache from the abundance of unbelievable bargains! Now, as much as I would dearly love to further expound on the unrivaled quality of our merchandise, I must tend to a cargo but newly arrived at the docks─"
72,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_33","Hm? You bear to me a octant from the hands of Baderon himself? By the Navigator, I must have left it behind in the Wench, along with a week's pay and several bell's worth of intoxicated memories!"
73,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_34","I am most grateful to have it back! This tool is a keepsake from my days as a ship captain, you see. You shall have recompense, and what better coin to receive than the wisdom of a master merchant!"
74,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_35","If it is simple and sturdy adventuring equipment you seek, you needn't go further than the East and West arms of Hawkers' Alley."
75,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_36","Should you wish to prepare for battle, equipping oneself with the best arms and armor one can afford is always gil well spent."
76,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_37","Hawkers' Alley has myriad stalls that specialize in the tools of war and offer you your choice of quality weaponry or protective gear."
77,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_38","And within but a few steps are bazaars and apothecaries that will most amply supply all your potion and perishable needs."
78,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_39","Our keen-eyed agents procure a befuddling range of wares during their sojourns to distant shores, thus it pays to become familiar with the type─and price─of the goods stocked by each particular shop."
79,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_40","Such knowledge will serve you well if your purse is light or your time is short."
80,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_SWOZBLAET_000_41","Shall I continue with this verbal instruction? Nay, I say more value is to be gained by wandering the markets yourself. Experience, even when bitter, is the surest teacher!"
81,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_50","よく来たな。
ここはリムサ・ロミンサを支える「巴術士ギルド」。"
82,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_51","ここ「巴術士ギルド」は、
両の手に力を込めてあらゆるものをたたき切る
「巴術」の使い手が集い、切磋琢磨する場。"
83,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_52","……君は、巴術士を志す冒険者だな？
ならば、我ら「巴術士ギルド」について手短に紹介しよう。"
84,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_53","「斧」は、古来より「船」と密接な関係にあった。
船を造るために必要となる木材は、
斧によって切り出される。"
85,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_54","さらに航海中の不測の事態に備えるため、
船に乗り込む船大工たちもまた、斧を携えていた。
つまり斧とは、造船と修復のための道具だったのだ。"
86,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_55","そして、船に持ち込まれた道具は、やがて武器となる。
斧頭を引っかけ敵船に乗り移り、力任せに振い、
すべてを叩きつぶすためのね。"
87,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_56","こうして「船乗りの武器」である
斧の扱いが巴術へと発展した。
特に腕っ節が物を言う海賊たちの世界でな。"
88,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_57","海賊たちは、自身の船に優秀な戦闘員をそろえるため
海賊志願者に巴術を教え始めた。
これが、巴術士ギルドの始まりだ。"
89,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_58","しかし、帝国や蛮族に対抗するため、
この都市の首領メルウィブ提督と海賊諸派が手を結び
「ガラディオン協定」を締結したことで状況は一変した。"
90,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_59","「海賊養成所」だった巴術士ギルドは、
海賊から切り離され、独立、再編されることとなった。
真に巴術を学ぶ場へと生まれ変わったってわけだな。"
91,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_60","私欲に駆られた海賊ではなく、
公の利益に貢献するために武を用いる者……、
新しい巴術士ギルドが育てるのは、そういう人材さ。"
92,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_61","あんたも斧を極めるつもりなら、
我らがギルドへ入門し、鍛練に励むべきだね。"
93,"TEXT_MANSEA003_00109_MURIE_000_62","心を決めたら、もう一度あたしに声かけな。
入門のための手続きを教えてやるよ。"
