171,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_182","Primals, you see, feed upon aether to exist. And the stronger they become, the more aether they need."

173,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_184","Alas, this alone does not suffice to sustain a powerful being such as Ifrit. Nay, he and his kind require a more concentrated source of aether─crystals."

178,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_189","These cries serve as a beacon which draw together a primal's essence. Thus are the beings brought forth into the world."
179,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_190","Once born, a primal grows stronger through the pleas and prayers of its followers. The more numerous and fervent they are, the more powerful their god becomes."
180,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_THANCRED_000_191","But the primals are voracious creatures, and voluntary reverence, I'm afraid, does not satisfy them.

181,"TEXT_MANFST209_00343_MINFILIA_000_192","Yet even as Ifrit took your comrades in his thrall, you alone remained unaffected. This is thanks to the power you possess─the Echo."
