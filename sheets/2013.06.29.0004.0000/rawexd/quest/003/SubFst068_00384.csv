55,"TEXT_SUBFST068_00384_ARMELLE_000_32","I shall organize a vessel for a later time, then. Perhaps a bell from now? Two? Better make it three, just to be safe. Thank you for your trouble."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST068_00384_LEONNIE_000_21","I must linger here a while longer. Please head to the Mirror Planks and convey my apologies to Armelle."
