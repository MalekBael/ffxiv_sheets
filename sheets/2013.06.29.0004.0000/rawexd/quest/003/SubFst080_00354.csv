2,"TEXT_SUBFST080_00354_SEQ_02","You are somewhat taken aback by the unrestrained delight with which Monne greets your delivery of salt-cured antelope. Sensing your surprise, she explains that the Hawthorne Hut's proximity to the Honey Yard means that almost every dish features the bees' nectar-sweet bounty. In this context, even the humblest of savory snacks can seem a rare delicacy indeed."

54,"TEXT_SUBFST080_00354_MONNE_000_14","Yes, well, that means we always─and I do mean <Emphasis>always</Emphasis>─have a ready supply of honey. Honey is so common in these parts, in fact, that it's used to flavor almost every dish we eat. And then there's the mead... <shudder> The stuff may be a rare treat elsewhere, but when you've had as much honey as I have, salt-cured antelope seems like a delicacy fit to grace the table of the sultana of Ul'dah. In short, I could hug you. Ahem."
