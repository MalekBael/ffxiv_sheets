In order to ensure the safety of the sylphs, Hearer Imedia bids you slay five ziz gorlins and five gnats."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST085_00359_IMEDIA_000_2","Being a temporary settlement, Little Solace wants for amenities, not least a stout set of defenses. Consequently, beasts from malms around are free to wander in and terrorize the hapless residents."

51,"TEXT_SUBFST085_00359_IMEDIA_000_11","My sincerest thanks, adventurer. With the population of wild creatures thusly thinned, the sylphs will be able to live in peace...for a time."
52,"TEXT_SUBFST085_00359_IMEDIA_000_12","Alas, this solution is no more permanent than the settlement of Little Solace itself. It would be best if the sylphs could return to their homeland, but present circumstance will not permit that possibility."
53,"TEXT_SUBFST085_00359_IMEDIA_000_13","The sylphs face an uncertain future. Yet no matter how long it takes, with the elementals' guidance, we will see them safely home."
