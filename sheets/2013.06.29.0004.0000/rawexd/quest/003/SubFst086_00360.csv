56,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_AMEEXIA_000_43","But this one was too afraid to go near. Shadowy ones were scary-looking..."

I can ill afford to abandon my post for so much as a moment if imperial troopers are abroad."

67,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_ZACHEUS_000_73","Adventurer, I must ask yet another favor of you. Swiftly bear word of our plight to Maximiloix at Amarissaix's Spire. Tell him that Little Solace has need of reinforcements."
68,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_MAXIMILOIX_000_51","Trouble brewin' in Little Solace, eh? Imperials workin' hand in glove with bandits, bearin' mystery cargo..."
69,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_MAXIMILOIX_000_52","I mus' say, that <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> ring a bell... Not more'n a few days ago, we caught usselves a lone bandit. An' what should we find in the crafty bugger's pocket but a shiny-lookin' weapon like naught we'd ever seen before."
70,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_MAXIMILOIX_000_53","Now, your mystery boxes're news to me, but if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say Garlean weaponry's bein' smuggled into the wood. At any rate, Zacheus'll have his reinforcements."
71,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_MAXIMILOIX_000_54","In the meantime, I want you to go to the Hawthorne Hut an' tell ol' Rolfe Hawthorne to be wary o' bandits. There's a garrison right by his property, 'tis true, but better safe than sorry, as I always say."
72,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_ROLFE_000_61","Yes? A message from Amarissaix's Spire, you say?"
73,"TEXT_SUBFST086_00360_ROLFE_000_62","Bandits armed with Garlean weaponry!? Gods... This information may well save lives, friend. My thanks to you for sharing it. I shall be doubly vigilant, and relay your warning to all who pass through here."
