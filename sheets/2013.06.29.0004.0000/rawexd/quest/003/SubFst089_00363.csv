49,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_FLORIMOND_000_2","I am Florimond, a sentry of Josselin's Spire...though you would be forgiven for imagining me a sentry of this hut, so seldom have I left it in recent days. I sustained an injury, you see, the nature of which I am loath to recount, so embarrassing is the tale. Suffice it to say, I have been out of commission ever since."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_FLORIMOND_000_3","Anyway, my Wood Wailer comrades are about to commence a culling operation in the Bramble Patch, and the thought of them marching into the jaws of danger while I languish here like a coddled babe is frankly too much to bear."

55,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_ANIUD_000_21","So you have seen to the black bats. We couldn't have asked for a better substitute. You have my gratitude."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_ANIUD_000_22","Now, at the risk of seeming brazen, I would ask you a favor of my own. Might you bear a message to Florimond for me?"
57,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_ANIUD_000_23","The lad is being overly hard on himself for his absence. Tell him that his fretting avails no one, he himself least of all. He serves the Wood Wailers best by getting back on his feet with all swiftness─and <Emphasis>that</Emphasis> requires peace of mind."
58,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_FLORIMOND_000_31","Ah, you're back! Tell me, how fared the operation? Were there any casualties? Gods, tell me no one was hurt!"

60,"TEXT_SUBFST089_00363_FLORIMOND_000_33","I see... <sigh> The captain speaks true. I must say, a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders. As bade, I shall focus all my energies on recovery, the sooner to resume my duties. My thanks again, friend."
