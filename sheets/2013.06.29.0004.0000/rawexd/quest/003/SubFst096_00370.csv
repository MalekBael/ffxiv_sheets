1,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_SEQ_01","The researchers surveying the ruins at Issom-Har are overdue for their regular visit to Buscarron's Druthers. Head south to the nearby ruins, and look for the researcher known as “Irielle.”"
2,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_SEQ_02","The unsuspecting victims of a band of mischievous wind sprites, Irielle and her colleague had until recently been stranded at the bottom of a deep pit, courtesy of a detached rope ladder. Though thankfully none the worse for the ordeal, the lead researcher is not amused. She asks that you discourage the wind sprites from contemplating any further life-threatening pranks by summarily slaying three of their number."
3,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_SEQ_03","You have taught the wind sprites a hard lesson. Inform Irielle at Issom-Har of your deeds."
4,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_SEQ_04","Irielle and her colleague can now continue their survey, free of wind sprite foolery. She explains that the ruins visible below are a part of Gelmorra, the ancient Duskwight Elezen city. The serendipitous uncovering of the underground settlement presents the researcher a rare opportunity to learn more about her ancestors."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_BUSCARRON_000_2","They usually turn up at the Druthers every few days, covered in dust and hungering for a hot meal, but they've not been in for nigh on a week."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_BUSCARRON_000_3","Could well be that they're up to their necks in scholarly business, but they'd be running low on supplies by now, and that got me thinking. So, get down to them ruins, and see if aught's amiss. You're looking for a lass by the name of “Irielle,” by the way. I forget the other one's name."
51,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_11","Yes, may I help you with something? Ah, Buscarron was concerned for our well-being? How positively sweet of him, but as you can see, we are both quite hale and decidedly not deceased."
52,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_12","We did, however, encounter certain practical difficulties when a band of playful wind sprites took it upon themselves to return our rope ladder to us─while we were at the bottom of this rather deep pit. Your timing is impeccable as we have only just succeeded in clambering out."
53,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_13","In fact, since you are here, perhaps you might prevent a repetition of this harmless prank by slaughtering a number of the local wind sprites? Say, three or so? That should be sufficient to demonstrate our lack of appreciation for their humor."
54,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_21","Many thanks. Perhaps now we might return to our research in relative peace. Hm? Oh, the ruins you can see down there are part of the ancient subterranean city known as Gelmorra."
55,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_22","This section was uncovered when a great rock fell from the sky during the Calamity and gouged a sizable hole in the earth."
56,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_23","For Duskwight Elezen such as ourselves, it represents a valuable and unexpected opportunity to learn more about the settlement where our ancestors once dwelled."
57,"TEXT_SUBFST096_00370_IRIELLE_000_24","Yet...as fascinating as the ruins undoubtedly are, I do believe I have had my fill of the inside of that hole for the time being..."
