1,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_SEQ_01","It seems that Keroucene, a new worker at the Druthers, has been sneaking around outside the tavern after nightfall. Buscarron doesn't wish to doubt the recently reformed bandit, but cannot afford to take any chances. He asks that you head to the south of the tavern to where Keroucene has been lurking, and find out what's afoot."

4,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_SEQ_04","Buscarron asks that you punish Keroucene for his treachery. Follow the bandit's trail back to Redbelly Hive, and give him his just deserts."
5,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_SEQ_05","With the unexpected assistance of the residents of Redbelly Hive, you administer Keroucene's punishment. Return to the Druthers and tell Buscarron the conclusion to this sorry tale."
6,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_SEQ_06","Buscarron is relieved to hear that Keroucene will trouble him no longer. He is also pleasantly surprised by the Redbelly brigands' uncharacteristic declaration of loyalty."

49,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_2","Well, since you asked, one of my new workers─Keroucene─has been acting strange. He's taken to sneaking out to the south of the tavern late at night and getting up to gods know what."
50,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_3","Now, the lad only recently turned his back on banditry, and I thought at first he might be having a hard time adjusting to a life of honest labor. But the way he's been skulking about makes me think there's more to it..."

57,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_21","What's afoot? Sounded like all seven hells were breaking loose outside! Hm?  You found Keroucene with a bunch of barrels? And then you were attacked?"
58,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_22","Ah, now it all makes sense. I knew someone had been switching out my ale for some cheap swill, but I thought─had hoped─that the culprit was someone who didn't work for me..."
59,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_23","It ain't so much the ale, see, it's the betrayal of trust. I took the lad in when no bugger else would, and he's spat in the face of everyone who works here."

63,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_52","Well bugger me... That was an unexpected twist to the story. 'Specially for young Keroucene. Heh heh."
64,"TEXT_SUBFST099_00373_BUSCARRON_000_53","And they really said the enemies of the Druthers are no friends of the Redbelly, did they?"
