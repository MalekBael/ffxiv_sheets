1,"TEXT_SUBSEA106_00403_SEQ_01","With the lighthouse beam having grown dangerously dim, the ships on the water could soon find themselves sailing into unseen hazards. Visit the Brewer's Beacon and discover what has befallen Khanswys, the lighthouse keeper."

5,"TEXT_SUBSEA106_00403_SEQ_05","Though the bomb claw is able to power the lighthouse beacon for the time being, Khanswys is dubious about the quality of her makeshift repairs. Return to Swiftperch and report the situation to Fraeloef."
6,"TEXT_SUBSEA106_00403_SEQ_06","Fraeloef intends to file reports regarding the incident at the lighthouse, but is concerned about the fragile state of the furnace. The Yellowjacket requests that you make haste to the Armorers' Guild and ask Forgemaster H'naanza to oversee the necessary repairs."
7,"TEXT_SUBSEA106_00403_SEQ_07","After hearing your request, Forgemaster H'naanza agrees to have the faulty furnace repaired. The armorer mentions, with some irritation, that the furnace was only just recently fixed. It seems that the bomb trapped inside may have been overly volatile, but could there be another reason for the device's failure...?"
