1,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_SEQ_01","Taken by an inexplicable urge to be witty, you incorporate the order's password, “wild rose,” into a poetic verse by way of agreeing to help. Minfilia has the grace to play along with your silliness, and welcomes you to the Scions. She introduces you to its core members: the scholars of Sharlayan, some of whom you have already met. Without further ado, you are assigned your first task─an investigation of two primal-related crimes in Ul'dah. Speak with Thancred, the debonair minstrel, to learn the details of your mission."
2,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_SEQ_02","Thancred believes that the caravan robbery and the abductions are connected, and suggests that you first look into the missing persons. Make your way to Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan, and seek the cooperation of a man named Isembard."

66,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000100_MINFILIA","The Sharlayans were the keepers of wisdom both old and new. Their mastery over magick and aether was unsurpassed, and even the Garleans knew to fear them."

85,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000290_YSHTOLA","At the Battle of Carteneau, our leader was taken from us. But we did not stray from our purpose."
86,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000300_YSHTOLA","We sought out Minfilia and others with her talent, and together established the Scions of the Seventh Dawn."

91,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000350_MINFILIA","But without further ado..."
92,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000360_MINFILIA","I would assign you your first task."
93,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000370_MINFILIA","Urianger. Have the documents arrived from the Students of Baldesion?"
94,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000380_URIANGER","Aye, they arrived but recently."
95,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000390_MINFILIA","We have received a request for aid from the Immortal Flames."
96,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000400_MINFILIA","Thancred, would you do the honors?"
97,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000410_THANCRED","It would be my pleasure."
98,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000420_THANCRED","Some days ago, a crystal caravan registered to Amajina & Sons' Mineral Concern was waylaid and divested of its cargo."
99,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000430_THANCRED","But there is more. Within a bell of the robbery, several people were reported missing from the shantytown outside the city."
100,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000440_MINFILIA","At a glance, one would assume the involvement of bandits, kidnappers, and coincidence."
101,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000450_MINFILIA","Such crimes are hardly uncommon, and the Immortal Flames deal with their like almost every day."
102,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000460_MINFILIA","However, this time we have reason to believe that a primal is involved."
103,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000470_THANCRED","Aye, the evidence left behind implicates the Amalj'aa, who are known worshipers of Ifrit."
104,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000480_THANCRED","If we then consider the objects that were taken, there is no room left for doubt─the crimes were committed in the name of a primal."
105,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000490_MINFILIA","That you may better understand the nature of our struggle with the primals, I would have you play the leading role in this investigation."
106,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000500_MINFILIA","You have my thanks."
107,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000510_MINFILIA","If there is aught you wish to know, I recommend you speak with Thancred. He is well-versed in the affairs of Ul'dah."
108,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_000520_THANCRED","Ever at your service, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>fair lady<Else/>dear fellow</If>!"
109,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_10","Ready to begin, are we? That's the spirit!"
110,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_11","By way of a review, your mission is to investigate two crimes─crystal robbery and serial abductions."
111,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_12","They are very likely connected. What discoveries we make in one are bound to further our knowledge of the other."
112,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_13","Now, ever since the attack on their caravan, Amajina & Sons Mining Concern has doubled security over all their shipments."
113,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_14","And so it is my judgment that the abductions should be our priority."
114,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_15","At this juncture, we know that more people have vanished from around Camp Drybone than any other location. We could do worse than to begin by gathering information there."
115,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_THANCRED_000_16","A fellow by the name of Isembard serves as the camp's de facto leader. Let us solicit his cooperation."
116,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_20","Aye, I'm Isembard. Here to search for the missing folk, I take it?"
117,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_21","Minfilia sent word that an adventurer fitting your description would be along."
118,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_22","She also warned us to be wary of the Amalj'aa. It seems we know who the culprits are, at the very least."
119,"TEXT_MANFST207_00510_ISEMBARD_000_23","Now, I bear no official title at this camp, but the people here have come to look to me for leadership. I'll do all I can to help see the victims safely returned."
