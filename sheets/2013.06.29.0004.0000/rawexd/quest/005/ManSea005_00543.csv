1,"TEXT_MANSEA005_00543_SEQ_01","It seems that a gang of vicious-looking men with blue-tattooed faces have been eyeing the workers on the farm. The farmhands, unsettled by the scrutiny, believe their unwelcome visitors to be the rumored kidnappers, and the resulting atmosphere of terror has taken a considerable toll on the farm's productivity. Head to Seasong Grotto, and investigate the area that reports claim to be the tattooed thugs' hideout."
2,"TEXT_MANSEA005_00543_SEQ_02","At Seasong Grotto, your encounter with a strangely bespectacled woman is suddenly interrupted by the charge of an enraged goobbue. After discovering a seafarer's knife stuck into the defeated goobbue's back, the woman seems convinced that the perpetrators of the kidnappings are almost certainly pirates. Return to Summerford Farms and present your findings to Staelwyrn."
3,"TEXT_MANSEA005_00543_SEQ_03","Staelwyrn explains that the lady with the spectacles is a scholar by the name of Y'shtola, and assures you that she is unconnected with the abductions. The farmer also concurs with Y'shtola's theory concerning the likely involvment of pirates. Thanking you for your part in the investigation, Staelwyrn bids you continue helping those in need and contribute to a better future for Limsa Lominsa."
