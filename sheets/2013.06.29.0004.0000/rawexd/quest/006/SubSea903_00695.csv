52,"TEXT_SUBSEA903_00695_OURAWANN_000_5","Very well, let's see what you can do. Ah, before you begin, I have a word of advice: acquire some cores from the lightning sprites."
53,"TEXT_SUBSEA903_00695_OURAWANN_000_6","Use the cores on the crabs, and you'll soon discover which creatures are the big claws."
