4,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_SEQ_04","You have spared the plants a grisly death at the maws of vilekin larva. Speak with Jospaire once more."
5,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_SEQ_05","Little to your surprise, Jospaire has yet another request. He bids you pour stingbrew over thick bramble and slay any syrphid clouds that come forth."

49,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_2","Ahem, you must forgive me. I was just admiring the plants sprouting about this goobbue carcass, and well, I suppose I forgot myself in the moment."
50,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_3","But truly, have you ever seen such lovely flowers? I would wager that not even the wealthiest Ul'dahns have ever seen their like before."
51,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_4","Please, a favor, I beg of you. I dare not let these beauties out of my sight! But their soil is parched and the plants wilting. Would you fetch me some muddy spring water from the pond to the west?"

54,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_12","I fear that is not all I must ask of you. The petals and stems are covered with vilekin eggs. Should they hatch, the larva will devour every last leaf, petal, and stem! Please, you must remove any eggs that you find."

56,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_21","But one more that yet remains. Syrphid clouds still lurk among the undergrowth. If left unchecked, they will infest the plants with their eggs once more."
57,"TEXT_SUBWIL127_00637_JOSPAIRE_000_22","Here, this stingbrew is sure to bring the beasts out of hiding. Pour it over any thick bramble you see, and slay whatever comes forth!"
