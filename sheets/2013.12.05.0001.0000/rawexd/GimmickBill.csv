Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 1)
Strange lights sighted from just inside dungeon entrance. Creatures of the forest? Closer inspection reveals them to be man-made machines. Ashcrown Consortium technologist accompanying party believes them to be of Garlean design. Labels them “magitek photocells.” Collect for further study."

Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 2)
Dramatic increase in light emitted by photocells observed upon collecting fourth. Dispatched two lancers to Gridania with orders to deliver the photocells to Stillglade Fane. Soon after their departure, received linkpearl transmission from pair reporting marked reduction in photocell glow as distance from Maws increased. Recalled lancers."

Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 3)
Lancer downed attempting to breach what Ashcrown technologist calls a “magitek field.” Technologist advises that there should be a device in the vicinity powering the barrier. No choice but to look for it. Divided party into four teams to expedite search. Whisperings of discontent? No. Just my imagination."
5,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 4)
Device located, but one team yet to return. Barrier terminal unresponsive until technologist suggests applying set of four photocells. How does he know these things? Watch him. Lancer suggests locating missing team. Decide to press on."

Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 5)
Encountered sheer drop several yalms down passage. Rock face looks treacherous but descent should be possible with ropes. Return climb may be troublesome─especially with the technologist slowing us down. Lancers seem uncertain. After consulting with second officer, have decided to proceed. Will send scouts to find alternate route back to entrance."
7,"First Spear Rydel
Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 6)
Discovered mangled bodies of the missing team beyond the drop. Have lost linkpearl contact with the two scouts sent to find alternate route out. Presumed lost or deserted. Will continue expedition for now, but must consider retreat if situation worsens."

Toto–Rak Expedition Notes  (Day 7)
Three lancers report difficulty breathing, as if something dank and heavy is clogging their lungs. Another two disappeared into the darkness, screaming. Technologist believes cause to be extreme levels of aetheric energy detected ahead. Lies. He has done something to us! The elementals warned me about him. Should have listened. Technologist suggests turning back. I see him for what he is now. Garlean worm is dead. Feel better. Pressing on."
