2104,"Remember your roles within the party and communicate with your allies. Those are the keys to victory!"
2105,"If a bomb is tossed your way, do not panic. Simply retreat until it detonates and then return to the front lines."
2106,"I shall give the goblins credit where credit is due. It must have taken them a half turn of the sun to drag these crates into place... Now demolish them!"
2107,"The first station is toppled, but another lies near the top of the heavenspillar. Forward, adventurers!"
2108,"The goblins' leader, Stikflix Grumblytoss, awaits ahead! Give him no quarter!"
2109,"Stikflix Grumblytoss may not appear to be the most formidable of foes, but his realm-shaking explosives make him a force to be reckoned with. If one happens to land in your vicinity, you would take my advice and run."

That was some proper combat, if I do say so meself."

It's the only way to see Buso weakened!"
