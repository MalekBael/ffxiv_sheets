1285,2,3,False,1,"Look behind you! A three-headed goobbue!"
1286,2,3,False,1,"Fall in behind the pilus prior!"
1287,2,3,False,1,"All hail the emperor!"
1288,2,3,False,1,"Eorzea will not be yours for long!"
1289,2,3,False,1,"I'll show you why the 3rd cohort is most feared in the legion!"
1290,2,3,False,1,"Follow me!"
1291,2,3,False,1,"The young ones must not fall into dark hands!"
1292,2,3,False,1,"This one's heart is overtaken with wroth!"
1293,2,3,False,1,"The spoken ones must leave at once!"
1294,2,3,False,1,"Mine! All mine! Sqwaaark!"
1295,2,3,False,1,"Take! Take! Take, we shall!"
1296,2,3,False,1,"Sqwark!"
1297,2,3,False,1,"Die...  Die... "
1298,2,3,False,1,"Vengeance... "
1299,3,5,False,1,"Good adventurer! A great dragon approaches!"
1300,2,3,False,1,"Svara will not wait for us. Come!"
1301,2,3,False,1,"Have your weapon ready. It is not a question of if the Horde finds us, but when."
1302,2,3,False,1,"If only Bertha were here. She'd rip a hole right through 'em!"
1303,2,3,False,1,"Hurry. The Steel Vigil is not far."
1304,2,3,False,1,"Thank you! But my work today has only just begun."
1305,2,3,False,1,"So...so many... "
1306,2,3,False,1,"Bugger, I can't go on... "
1307,3,3,False,1,"It appears we have made it with all our limbs still attached."
1308,3,3,False,1,"The gigas are naught but cowards."
1309,3,3,False,1,"They wouldn't hesitate to attack an unguarded caravan, but place a few blades at the van and─"
1310,3,3,False,1,"You might want to wait before completing that thought."
1311,3,3,False,1,"Th-Th-They don't look all that cowardly from here!"
1312,3,3,False,1,"Shields together! Form a wall around the findings!"
1313,3,3,False,1,"Not even time for a piss, eh?"
1314,3,3,False,1,"Less talk, boys. More blood!"
1315,2,3,False,1,"Our rage, our rancor... "
1316,2,3,False,1,"For you... For you... "
1317,2,3,False,1,"Did it escape!?"
1318,2,3,False,1,"The rancor! The rancor!"
1319,2,3,False,1,"Behind us!?"
1320,2,3,False,1,"Take that, vile fiend!"
1321,2,3,False,1,"Come...♪"
1322,3,3,False,1,"Thank the saints!"
1323,3,3,False,1,"In most circumstances, I would commend you on your bravery and send you on your way."
1324,3,3,False,1,"...but these documents aren't going to carry themselves to the camp."
1325,3,3,False,1,"Seems the gigas had a bit more fight in them than I thought."
1326,3,3,False,1,"Not <Emphasis>enough</Emphasis> fight is how I see it. Hah!"
1327,3,3,False,1,"When you boys are done patting yourselves on the back, we've still got work to do."
1328,3,3,False,1,"The documents..."
1329,3,3,False,1,"They were...irreplaceable! A lifetime of knowledge...gone!"
1330,3,3,False,1,"What am I to tell the Sons!?"
1331,3,3,False,1,"We're lucky to have made it out with out hearts still beating."
1332,3,3,False,1,"That doesn't make the taste any less bitter."
1333,3,3,False,1,"That will teach you to underestimate your enemy, fools."
1334,2,3,False,1,"This hammer will not hold them back for long!"
1335,2,3,False,1,"Stay away!"
1336,2,3,False,1,"Try and keep the dragons from nippin' our arses."
1337,2,3,False,1,"Once Bertha here is hale and hearty, we'll show them dragons what for!"
1338,2,3,False,1,"Keep one eye on the sky, and the other on the ground. Not all the horde have wings!"
1339,2,3,False,1,"I need more time. Bertha's a fickle lass."
1340,2,3,False,1,"No more of this for me! I'm back to the Locks!"
1341,2,3,False,1,"Ol' Bertha's standing once again! Now where's that dragon!?"
1342,2,3,False,1,"Thou...♪"
1343,2,3,False,1,"Why...♪"
1344,2,3,False,1,"No...♪"
1345,3,3,False,1,"Isn't there anyone who can help me?"
1346,3,5,False,1,"We must move these logs to the library for proper cataloging."
1347,3,5,False,1,"Oh, dear. Not here... Not now!"
1348,3,5,False,1,"The Horde!"
1349,3,7,False,1,"The Dravanian Horde attacks!"
1350,2,5,False,1,"I'll slice your throat and kick you from Witchdrop!"
1351,2,5,False,1,"For the Fury! For Ishgard!"
1352,2,5,False,1,"The logs... They are lost..."
1353,3,5,False,1,"Now to collect the tears."
1354,3,5,False,1,"Water sprites! How in the Fury's name will I fill my phials!?"
1355,3,5,False,1,"Enough of this place. A warm hearth awaits me back beyond the Gates of Judgement."
1356,3,5,False,1,"My client will be...disappointed, to say the least."
1357,3,5,False,1,"Then let us make haste."
1358,3,5,False,1,"I pray Haldrath's March is clear."
1359,3,5,False,1,"We must hurry. The archbishop is not one to be made to wait."
1360,3,5,False,1,"These astroscope readings could change the outcome of the war. They cannot be lost!"
1361,3,5,False,1,"I can see the aetheryte's glow. We are almost arrived!"
1362,3,5,False,1,"My thanks, adventurer. You were more than a capable escort."
1363,3,5,False,1,"Now I must be off to find that courier. Good day!"
1364,3,5,False,1,"What in the world is that thing!?"
1365,3,5,False,1,"Wolves!"
1366,3,5,False,1,"Good gracious! Look at the size of that maw!"
1367,3,5,False,1,"But we are so close!"
1368,2,5,False,1,"Aaahhh!"
1369,2,5,False,1,"The findings! I must protect them!"
1370,2,5,False,1,"Keep it off of me!"
1371,2,3,False,1,"What is─?"
1372,3,5,False,1,"These readings must be delivered..."
1373,3,5,False,1,"Where did these things come from!? They weren't here a bell ago!"
1374,3,5,False,1,"They're making for the camp! Someone <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> something!"
1375,3,5,False,1,"That was too close..."
1376,3,5,False,1,"Curse these little legs!"
1377,2,5,False,1,"Hapalits!? You look as if you could use some help!"
1378,2,5,False,1,"Ah, the thrill of victory!"
1379,2,5,False,1,"At least we were able to force them back..."
1380,2,3,False,1,"Those Mamool Ja wear the sign of the Crag! Their loyalty has been bought by the kobolds!"
1381,2,3,False,1,"This road cannot fall into beastman hands!"
1382,2,3,False,1,"Drive the sellswords to the seventh hell!"
1383,2,3,False,1,"As long as their pockets are lined, they'll be back."
1384,2,3,False,1,"Fall back and inform the camp that the road is compromised!"
1385,2,3,False,1,"This road now kobold road. Pay in gil or pay in blood!"
1386,2,3,False,1,"Too many blades. Not enough coin promised."
1387,2,3,False,1,"The Climb is safe...for the moment."
1388,2,3,False,1,"These puppets cannot be contained! We must fall back and regroup!"
1389,2,5,False,1,"The area ahead is under kobold control."
1390,2,5,False,1,"The beastmen <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> make an attempt at our supplies."
1391,2,3,False,1,"And we will see that they fail, sir!"
1392,2,3,False,1,"Gwark!"
1393,2,3,False,1,"What do you see, sir!?"
1394,2,3,False,1,"It's not what I see...but what I smell..."
1395,2,3,False,1,"...and I smell kobolds!"
1396,2,3,False,1,"It's an ambush!"
1397,2,3,False,1,"Sir, behind us!"
1398,2,3,False,1,"Shields up!"
1399,2,3,False,1,"Gwark! Gwaaaaaark!"
1400,2,3,False,1,"We're out of the fire, but not clear of the kitchen. Push ahead!"
1401,2,3,False,1,"You have Limsa's thanks, adventurer."
1402,2,3,False,1,"Someone! Help!"
1403,2,3,False,1,"We are still quite far from our destination. Stay close."
1404,2,3,False,1,"Stay close. Understood."
1405,2,3,False,1,"If I were any closer, you could smell the squirrel I ate this morning."
1406,2,3,False,1,"Come then."
1407,2,3,False,1,"Kwark! Kwark! Kweeeh!"
1408,2,3,False,1,"Blasted 'bo!"
1409,2,3,False,1,"Well that was interesting..."
1410,2,3,False,1,"What should we do?"
1411,2,3,False,1,"We cannot leave without that bird. He's carrying half our charge!"
1412,2,3,False,1,"How's this─you two wait here with the good 'bo, and I'll look for the other?"
1413,2,3,False,1,"Are you sure that's a good idea? The jungle is rife with danger."
1414,2,3,False,1,"Kwaaaaaark!"
1415,2,3,False,1,"What in the seven hells is wrong with you? You've been kwarking since we left!"
1416,2,3,False,1,"Oh... That would be why..."
1417,2,3,False,1,"That was closer than I would have liked."
1418,2,3,False,1,"Where is that drunken fool?"
1419,2,3,False,1,"That was quite the piss. Are you sufficiently relieved, then?"
1420,2,3,False,1,"Bah, I'd tell you, but you wouldn't believe me anyway."
1421,2,3,False,1,"And that we can agree on."
1422,2,3,False,1,"I suppose there are worse ways to die..."
1423,2,3,False,1,"...I just cannot think of any."
1424,3,3,False,1,"They've eaten my love...again!"
1425,3,3,False,1,"<whimper>..."
1426,3,3,False,1,"<click> <click> <click>"
1427,3,3,False,1,"You are truly a hero! If only I could find a man like you!"
1428,3,3,False,1,"Now do what heroes do!"
1429,3,3,False,1,"<hiss>"
1430,3,3,False,1,"Not me! That one! Eat that one!"
1431,2,3,False,1,"Many sparklies for Jijiroon. Jijiroon overjoyed!"
1432,2,3,False,1,"Little sparklies for Jijiroon. Jijiroon drowns sorrows in pelican eggs."
1433,2,3,False,1,"<twitch> <twitch>"
1434,2,3,False,1,"La la la la la la la la la LA LA LA LA LA LA la LA la LA LA!"
1435,2,3,False,1,"Thisoneisthisoneisthisoneis..."
1436,2,3,False,1,"Hah! Haha! Hahaha! Haaaaaa!"
1437,3,3,False,1,"Bad spoken one!
Bad spoken one!"
1438,3,3,False,1,"Who is the spoken one?"
1439,3,3,False,1,"Spokenonespokenonespokenone..."
1440,3,3,False,1,"Root! This one needs more root!"
1441,3,3,False,1,"This one's head is spinning and spinning and spinning and..."
1442,3,3,False,1,"Rooot! Roooooot!"
1443,3,3,False,1,"Why can I not bathe in springs!?"
1444,3,3,False,1,"I've already told you. It is forbidden."
1445,3,3,False,1,"My coin, same coin as smoothskins'!"
1446,3,3,False,1,"This is not about your <Emphasis>coin</Emphasis>. It is about your <Emphasis>behavior</Emphasis>."
1447,3,3,False,1,"What behavior!?"
1448,3,3,False,1,"Your...<Emphasis>leering</Emphasis>."
1449,3,3,False,1,"Mamool Ja have eyes. Eyes must see something!"
1450,3,3,False,1,"And the...unsightly grinding and gyrating of your pelvic region."
1451,3,3,False,1,"Ah! Traditional Mamool Ja bathing dance!"
1452,3,3,False,1,"I care not what you call it! It will not be tolerated!"
1453,2,3,False,1,"You cannot stop bathing dance!"
1454,2,3,False,1,"I pay my coin! I dance my dance!"
1455,2,3,False,1,"What is decided is decided!"
1456,2,3,False,1,"Leave this place and never return!"
1457,3,3,False,1,"Memories only fade if there is no one to remember them..."
1458,2,3,False,1,"This one is eternally grateful."
1459,2,3,False,1,"As long as this one has life, the memory of the fallen ones will endure."
1460,3,3,False,1,"Mamool Ja stay! <Emphasis>You</Emphasis> go!"
1461,3,3,False,1,"I'm afraid I cannot allow that!"
1462,3,3,False,1,"Today we march on the encampment!"
1463,2,2,False,1,"Sir!"
1464,3,3,False,1,"Whatever happens, do not break! Understood!?"
1465,2,2,False,1,"Understood!"
1466,3,3,False,1,"Do you want to live forever!?"
1467,2,3,False,1,"Yaaahhh!"
1468,3,5,False,1,"Enemies at the fore!"
1469,2,2,False,1,"Aye!"
1470,3,5,False,1,"Enemies to the rear!"
1471,3,5,False,1,"We're surrounded!"
1472,3,5,False,1,"The Amalj'aa... They knew we were coming!"
1473,3,5,False,1,"Reform the line! The encampment is ours!"
1474,3,5,False,1,"Grab the wounded and fall back!"
1475,3,5,False,1,"Something is amiss..."
1476,2,3,False,1,"Blow 'em a kiss, Bertha!"
1477,2,3,False,1,"Bertha'll keep you warm, foul dragon!"
1478,2,3,False,1,"Pay the lady no mind! She'll see you're well taken care of!"
1479,2,3,False,1,"You killed my brother!"
1480,2,3,False,1,"For the Fury! For Ishgard!"
1481,2,3,False,1,"Die, dragons! Each and every one of you!"
1482,2,3,False,1,"Victory!"
1483,2,3,False,1,"The day is ours!"
1484,3,5,False,1,"Where are those damn lizards?"
1485,3,5,False,1,"Did they spot us and circle around?"
1486,3,5,False,1,"Or was the scout mistaken...?"
1487,3,5,False,1,"<Emphasis>There</Emphasis> they are!"
1488,3,5,False,1,"Hold the pass! Don't let a single one through!"
1489,3,5,False,1,"The enemy is retreating!"
1490,3,5,False,1,"Then we regroup and make pursuit!"
1491,3,5,False,1,"Th-The enemy is retreating!"
1492,3,5,False,1,"Thank the Twelve!"
1493,2,3,False,1,"Ah hah hah hah hah!"
1494,2,3,False,1,"Tonight, the spoken ones die!"
1495,2,3,False,1,"This one's poisons consume minds! Corrupt souls!"
1496,2,3,False,1,"Give the spoken ones no quarter!"
1497,3,5,False,1,"Are they here?"
1498,3,5,False,1,"If I am not at the plant in a bell, I will be ruined!"
1499,3,5,False,1,"Splendid! Now let us hurry. There is no time to lose!"
1500,3,5,False,1,"What was that!? I think I saw something move!"
1501,3,5,False,1,"Or...not. Come on then."
1502,3,5,False,1,"Halt!"
1503,3,5,False,1,"One cannot be too careful, you know."
1504,3,5,False,1,"Shhh! Did you hear that? No?"
1505,3,5,False,1,"Wait! Now, you may think I am being overly cautious, but..."
1506,3,5,False,1,"You know how the proverb goes..."
1507,3,5,False,1,"It's better to be safe than strung up and gralloched by a bloodthirsty maniac!"
1508,3,5,False,1,"There is something ahead... I can <Emphasis>feel</Emphasis> it!"
1509,3,5,False,1,"We are not but a quarter malm from the plant but..."
1510,3,5,False,1,"I... I made it in one piece! Thank the Twelve!"
1511,3,5,False,1,"If only you could have gotten me here sooner!"
1512,3,5,False,1,"Alright, tell me you heard <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>!"
1513,3,5,False,1,"Caution can ofttimes be a man's best friend!"
1514,3,5,False,1,"You see! You see!
I felt it! I <Emphasis>felt</Emphasis> it!"
1515,3,5,False,1,"I have no coin! I promised it all to the adventurer! That's the one you want!"
1516,3,3,False,1,"Why...? Why no springs?"
1517,3,3,False,1,"Mamool Ja is man, like all men..."
1518,3,3,False,1,"Finally."
1519,3,3,False,1,"Now, back to...er...seeing that these women are...uh...safe. Yes."
1520,3,3,False,1,"No man talks ill of Mamool Ja custom and lives!"
1521,3,3,False,1,"You, lucky today. I come back tomorrow. I come back and dance!"
1522,3,3,False,1,"<moan>..."
1523,3,3,False,1,"And don't...come back..."
1524,2,5,False,1,"I'm not paying you another man's coin to let them manhandle me!"
1525,2,5,False,1,"Not the tunic! This cost me a fortune!"
1526,2,5,False,1,"I'm too rich to die!"
1527,2,5,False,1,"Mercy! Have Mercy!"
1528,2,5,False,1,"Stop playing around, adventurer, and get this thing off of me!"
1529,2,5,False,1,"Gods up above!"
1530,2,3,False,1,"This is looking bad..."
1531,3,3,False,1,"A fine spring that was! The view was simply spectacular!"
1532,2,3,False,1,"Oh... This is not good."
1533,2,3,False,1,"How am I to get back to camp?"
1534,3,3,False,1,"Oh, I cannot begin to express my gratitude!"
1535,3,3,False,1,"I was in a cold sweat for the duration."
1536,3,3,False,1,"Perhaps I should go back to the spring and warm up..."
1537,3,3,False,1,"What ever is a Lalafell to do?"
1538,3,3,False,1,"I suppose I'll just have to return to the spring and wait."
1539,3,3,False,1,"Though, now that I think about it, another dip would be quite refreshing!"
1540,2,3,False,1,"Why must you overdwellers always disturb my research! Why! Why!?"
1541,2,3,False,1,"My next experiment will use your blood! Your blood!"
1542,2,3,False,1,"The Gyve will not fall to the sons of man!"
1543,2,3,False,1,"No manner of spell or steel can penetrate our wall!"
1544,2,3,False,1,"My bow sees all!"
1545,2,3,False,1,"You will drown in a storm of arrows!"
1546,2,3,False,1,"Run! Your back will make an easy target!"
1547,3,3,False,1,"The Amalj'aa are attempting a summoning! We must silence them before it's too late!"
1548,3,3,False,1,"We've a hero in our midst."
1549,3,3,False,1,"Now march!"
1550,3,3,False,1,"Just as planned!"
1551,3,3,False,1,"This should keep the lizards quiet for a spell."
1552,3,3,False,1,"But don't think they won't be back. They always are."
1553,3,3,False,1,"How could this have happened!?"
1554,3,3,False,1,"If a few sand lizards cannot be stopped, then we are doomed!"
1555,3,3,False,1,"You have my thanks, adventurer. Do not let our failure here discourage you."
1556,3,5,False,1,"I must be returning soon, so if you happen to have a core or five in your pocket..."
1557,3,3,False,1,"The ceruleum is safe for another day! From stray vibrations, that is. A single bomb and...boom!"
1558,3,3,False,1,"Not as many cores as I had hoped..."
1559,3,3,False,1,"I'll just have to cross both fingers tonight, then."
1560,3,5,False,1,"It'll take me the better part of the day to move all these crates back up into Wineport..."
1561,3,5,False,1,"The buccaneers! Keep them back from me wine!"
1562,3,5,False,1,"Me wine! It's safe!"
1563,3,5,False,1,"It's still strewn about the ground... <sigh> But at least it's safe!"
1564,3,5,False,1,"Me wine... It's all gone..."
1565,3,5,False,1,"I think I needs me a drink..."
1566,2,5,False,1,"Me wine... I can't bear to look!"
1567,2,5,False,1,"The vintner'll have me head...if the pirates don't get it first!"
1568,2,5,False,1,"What was that shattering? Was it a bottle!?"
1569,2,5,False,1,"Back to the jungle with you, you dirty thieves!"
1570,2,5,False,1,"Leave this man be!"
1571,2,5,False,1,"Your head will look good on a pike above the hamlet gates!"
1572,2,5,False,1,"And don't think of coming back!"
1573,2,5,False,1,"I broke nary a sweat."
1574,2,5,False,1,"Damned pirates..."
1575,2,5,False,1,"We've failed you... Please accept our apologies."
1576,2,5,False,1,"A few more blades and we would have had them!"
1577,2,5,False,1,"I won't forget this!"
1578,2,5,False,1,"Out o' me way, dogs!"
1579,2,5,False,1,"Hahahahahaha!"
1580,2,5,False,1,"Looks like yer 'avin' a spot o' trouble wiv the wain!"
1581,2,5,False,1,"Who says the Twelve don't smile on pirates!?"
1582,2,5,False,1,"Ever 'eard o' the law o' possession!?"
1583,2,5,False,1,"Why buy what ye can take!?"
1584,2,5,False,1,"We'll be seein' ye again, peddler!"
1585,2,5,False,1,"Thal's balls!"
1586,2,5,False,1,"Back to the lair, boys!"
1587,2,5,False,1,"Tonight we drink deep!"
1588,2,3,False,1,"To the trees, sylvan ones!"
1589,2,3,False,1,"Leave the dead. They will only weigh us down."
1590,2,3,False,1,"To die at the hands of a beastman..."
1591,2,3,False,1,"The imperial ones foul the wood with smoke and soot!"
1592,2,3,False,1,"Revenge for fallen ones shall be swift!"
1593,2,3,False,1,"Now that the imperial unit is no more, the remaining sylphs have drawn back into the wood."
1594,2,3,False,1,"Or have they!?"
1595,2,3,False,1,"My thanks. Without your help, I would be lying there cold with the other imperial corpses."
1596,2,3,False,1,"Your treachery will not be allowed in the Twelveswood!"
1597,2,3,False,1,"For the Adder!"
1598,2,5,False,1,"Ye want some o' this!?"

1603,3,5,False,1,"Over there!"
1604,2,5,False,1,"The place'll be swarmin' wiv honeybees and the Admiral's 'ounds."
1605,2,5,False,1,"I ain't never met an 'oneybee I couldn't swat, nor an 'ound I couldn't kick."
1606,2,5,False,1,"I'm goin' to drink meself a river, that's what I'm goin' to do!"
1607,2,5,False,1,"Been a long while since I drunk me some real red. I've 'ad enough o' that shite Shorty makes in 'is boot."

1610,2,5,False,1,"Workin' up a right thirst, what wiv all this fightin'."
1611,2,5,False,1,"Ye 'ave no right to be here!"
1612,2,5,False,1,"Gah hah hah hah!"
1613,2,5,False,1,"We was just mindin' our own!"

1615,2,5,False,1,"Ye'll pay fer this! A pirate never forgets!"
1616,2,5,False,1,"Damn the Admiral's hounds to the seventh hell!"
1617,2,5,False,1,"There'll be no raidin' till these bloody 'urts mend."
1618,2,5,False,1,"Alright you filthy scrags! Your plan is up!"
1619,2,5,False,1,"Throw down your weapons or feel the brunt of the storm!"
1620,2,5,False,1,"This is easier than jointing a pig!"
1621,2,5,False,1,"What's wrong!? Having second thoughts!?"
1622,2,5,False,1,"All in a day's work."
1623,2,5,False,1,"When has a band of landlocked pirates ever been a match for the Maelstrom?"
1624,2,5,False,1,"The louder they are, the quieter it is when they fall."
1625,2,5,False,1,"Fall back! We'll regroup at Wineport!"
1626,2,5,False,1,"You haven't seen the last of us, scrags!"
1627,2,5,False,1,"Just try and take the hamlet!"
1628,3,5,False,1,"We cannot wait any longer."
1629,2,5,False,1,"There's no turning back now! Go!"
1630,2,3,False,1,"Till sea swallows all!"
1631,2,5,False,1,"I'll see to the tools!"
1632,2,3,False,1,"Stay alert!"
1633,2,5,False,1,"These are mine!"
1634,2,3,False,1,"Watch your back!"
1635,2,5,False,1,"And these would be mine."
1636,2,5,False,1,"That's strange... Shouldn't one of their leaders be overseeing the dig?"
1637,2,5,False,1,"What if this is not the main dig site?"
1638,2,5,False,1,"I wonder how the other units are faring."
1639,2,5,False,1,"Pipe it down, ladies. There is still equipment to destroy!"
1640,2,5,False,1,"Their leader!"
1641,2,5,False,1,"If we can slay her, the others will fall back!"
1642,2,5,False,1,"Tight formation, ladies!"
1643,2,5,False,1,"I can't believe it! We actually did it!"
1644,2,5,False,1,"Who would have thought that three storm privates could defeat a kobold matriarch!?"
1645,2,5,False,1,"Well, we <Emphasis>did</Emphasis> have some help."
1646,2,5,False,1,"I told you we should have waited until the main unit arrived..."
1647,2,5,False,1,"What were we thinking?"
1648,2,5,False,1,"I take full responsibility. Your lashes are mine."
1649,3,5,False,1,"What are you doing!? What! Are! You! Doing!?"
1650,3,5,False,1,"O Lord of Crags, forgive your lowly servant! I am not worthy! I am not worthy!"
1651,2,5,False,1,"Our shiny tools! Who will mend our shiny tools!?"
1652,2,5,False,1,"An eternity of pain and agony to those who harm our tools!"
1653,2,5,False,1,"Do not let the overdwellers escape! We take them before Titan!"
1654,2,5,False,1,"Stop the overdwellers! Stop them! Stop them! Stop them!"
1655,2,5,False,1,"I do not like this one bit..."
1656,2,5,False,1,"If our numbers were only greater..."
1657,2,5,False,1,"If we are to attack, we must do it before reinforcements arrive."
1658,2,5,False,1,"We have the element of surprise, but..."
1659,3,5,False,1,"Just a little further, boy."
1660,3,5,False,1,"Here, let me hand you the rei─"
1661,2,3,False,1,"Wark!"
1662,3,3,False,1,"What's wrong, boy?"
1663,2,3,False,1,"Wark! Wark! Kwaaark!"
1664,3,3,False,1,"Shhh... Calm down, now. What do you see?"
1665,3,3,False,1,"The kobolds!"
1666,2,3,False,1,"Waaark!"
1667,3,3,False,1,"Wait! I thought your leg was─! Damned bird! Get back here or I'll roast you and eat you rare!"
1668,3,5,False,1,"You have my thanks, adventurer."
1669,3,5,False,1,"Now, when I get my hands on that 'bo..."
1670,2,5,False,1,"I carry nothing! The 'bo has it all!"
1671,2,5,False,1,"It's not me you want, it's the 'bo!"
1672,2,5,False,1,"Look at me! Does it look like I have any crates of sun lemons under this tunic!?"
1673,2,5,False,1,"Not the face! Not the face!"
1674,2,5,False,1,"I'll see you in the seventh hell, you bloody coward!"
1675,2,5,False,1,"Who said a 'bo was a man's best friend!?"
1676,2,5,False,1,"Your tools, throw them down! Your weapons, throw them down!"
1677,2,5,False,1,"Do not hide them from us, overdweller! We can smell them!"
1678,2,5,False,1,"Does the overdweller wish to die like his friends?"
1679,2,5,False,1,"Bow down, overdweller!"
1680,3,5,False,1,"Won't anyone save my daughter!?"
1681,3,5,False,1,"Make ready. The shadows gather."
1682,3,5,False,1,"The rite of sacrifice is about to begin. Mwahahahahaha!"
1683,3,5,False,1,"I always find it amusing how trusting you adventurers are."
1684,3,5,False,1,"That is right. It is not I who am to be the sacrifice. It is <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>!"
1685,3,5,False,1,"You are not the chosen!"
1686,3,5,False,1,"Are there none who would take up their blade and join us?"
1687,3,5,False,1,"Hah hah hah! Then show us the stuff you're made of, adventurer!"
1688,3,5,False,1,"As stubborn as a rock, and as hard as a diamond. A formidable foe, that one."
1689,3,5,False,1,"He could've had a place in my unit...if he weren't dead! Hah hah hah!"
1690,3,5,False,1,"Well, now we know where the scaled bastard got his name."
1691,3,5,False,1,"But we'll be ready for him next time."
1692,3,5,False,1,"O great one! An offering of blood and bone I bring thee!"
1693,3,5,False,1,"Uwaaah!"
1694,3,5,False,1,"I'm coming!"
1695,3,5,False,1,"I won't give up!"
1696,3,5,False,1,"We have failed our lord again!"
1697,3,5,False,1,"Silence, you dithering fool!"
1698,3,5,False,1,"The day is far from over..."
1699,3,5,False,1,"Dalamud will yet drink of this one's lifeblood."
1700,3,5,False,1,"For we shall see to it personally!"
1701,2,3,False,1,"Aim low, thrust high!"
1702,2,3,False,1,"Hold that bank with your lives!"
1703,2,3,False,1,"Where did that damn 'bo get off to?"
1704,2,3,False,1,"Oi! Chocobo!"
1705,2,3,False,1,"There you are. What were you thinking, galloping off like that?"
1706,3,3,False,1,"Now, to rid me of this wine...wherever this may be."
1707,2,3,False,1,"I fear the worst for our friend. Watch the bird. I will be back."
1708,2,3,False,1,"This place is unsafe. Come on."
1709,2,3,False,1,"We will wait here for our third."
1710,2,3,False,1,"Jijiroon's had enough peckings and pawings for one day!"
1711,2,3,False,1,"Here Jijiroon waits!"
1712,2,3,False,1,"Steel your nerves, now."
1713,2,3,False,1,"It appears quiet, but only a fool puts his trust in silence."
1714,2,3,False,1,"Overdwellers come with food and steel! We take your steel we eat your food!"
1715,3,5,False,1,"Serve the Wailers, earn some coin!"
1716,3,5,False,1,"I sometimes marvel at the resourcefulness of you adventurers!"
1717,3,5,False,1,"This won't nearly be enough... I'd best just toss it into the river."
1718,3,3,False,1,"Tell the lot to move their arses."
1719,3,3,False,1,"We're being tracked."
1720,3,3,False,1,"March, you pitiful scum!"
1721,3,3,False,1,"No one keeps the Lord of the Inferno waiting and lives!"
1722,3,3,False,1,"You need not fear fate."
1723,3,3,False,1,"You will soon be one of us, free from all worry!"
1724,3,3,False,1,"Help us!"
1725,3,3,False,1,"If it is money you want, you can have it. Gems? I have more than you can carry! They're all yours!"
1726,3,3,False,1,"Please..."
1727,3,3,False,1,"I'll do anything you ask! Just free us!"
1728,3,3,False,1,"I let my guard down for but a moment...but 'twas a moment too long."
1729,3,3,False,1,"Now, I must find some way to escape these bonds."
1730,3,3,False,1,"You! Adventurer!"
1731,3,3,False,1,"Don't tell my unit you saw me here. They'd give me no end of it!"
1732,3,3,False,1,"I knew I heard something!"
1733,3,3,False,1,"Halt and lay down your weapons!"
1734,3,3,False,1,"Let the captives free and your punishment will be lightened!"
1735,3,3,False,1,"I've seen that captive before somewhere..."
1736,3,3,False,1,"The Immortal Flames!"
1737,3,3,False,1,"We're saved!"
1738,3,3,False,1,"Not yet we aren't... Something tells me those tempered won't give up without a fight."
1739,3,3,False,1,"(My unit! Out of all the units in all the realm, why did it have to be <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> unit?)"
1740,3,3,False,1,"Let the captives free, eh?"
1741,3,3,False,1,"So you can come over here and slay us like dogs?"
1742,3,3,False,1,"There is no truth in the words of the untempered!"
1743,3,3,False,1,"Then your lives are forfeit!"
1744,3,3,False,1,"Fellow Flames! Give them no quarter!"
1745,3,3,False,1,"Focus on the tempered! We'll free the rest once the dirty work is done!"
1746,3,3,False,1,"Three more gifts for Ifrit!"
1747,3,3,False,1,"The lord will be pleased!"
1748,3,3,False,1,"Unless we kill them all first!"
1749,3,3,False,1,"We're all going to die!"
1750,3,3,False,1,"Aaaaaahhh!"
1751,3,3,False,1,"Calm yourselves! Keep your heads down if you want to live!"
1752,3,3,False,1,"Good... My unit is none the wiser!"
1753,3,3,False,1,"Are you unhurt?"
1754,3,3,False,1,"There may be more tempered headed this way. You'd all best make for Little Ala Mhigo."
1755,3,3,False,1,"You... I'd know those ears anywhere..."
1756,3,3,False,1,"It's over! It's finally over!"
1757,3,3,False,1,"<sob> I thought... I thought..."
1758,3,3,False,1,"Might be I join the Flames myself!"
1759,3,3,False,1,"........."
1760,3,3,False,1,"Grrraaah! Damn you all!"
1761,3,3,False,1,"You cannot escape every time!"
1762,3,3,False,1,"We will rise again from the ashes!"
1763,3,3,False,1,"Hah hah! Where are your Twelve now!?"
1764,3,3,False,1,"Move, scum! There's no one left to save you now!"
1765,3,3,False,1,"Don't forget the wounded. They are still of some use."
1766,3,3,False,1,"My tariffs pay for <Emphasis>that</Emphasis>!?"
1767,3,3,False,1,"I will take my own life before becoming one of...one of them!"
1768,3,3,False,1,"I knew there was a reason I never joined the Flames."
1769,3,3,False,1,"And my unit is none th─ Wait! Who's going to rescue me now!?"
1770,3,3,False,1,"We cannot give up now! Where is my linkpearl!?"
1771,3,3,False,1,"Captain, my wounds... I cannot march no further today..."
1772,3,3,False,1,"That Lalafell... It was <Emphasis>him</Emphasis>, wasn't it!? That fool could have helped us!"
1773,2,3,False,1,"You chose...poorly!"
1774,2,3,False,1,"I shall rip apart your body as Dalamud gnaws upon your soul!"
1775,2,3,False,1,"Bleed! Bleed for the one true lord!"
1776,2,3,False,1,"The Hound stirs with each drop spilled!"
1777,2,3,False,1,"Watch your back, friend!"
1778,2,3,False,1,"Your defense is full of holes...as soon you will be!"
1779,2,3,False,1,"You drag your feet, friend!"
1780,2,3,False,1,"Did you see that? Of course you didn't!"
1781,3,3,False,1,"Stand still, you bloody thing!"
1782,3,3,False,1,"Oi! He's headin' your way!"
1783,3,3,False,1,"I've got him! I've got him!"
1784,3,3,False,1,"No, I've got him!"
1785,3,3,False,1,"And here I thought it was the rabbits who was swift."
1786,3,5,False,1,"Seven hells to purgatory! Another one lost."
1787,3,5,False,1,"Calm yourself! We'll just find ourselves another one. Come on!"
1788,2,5,False,1,"Keep your ears open and your eyes peeled."
1789,2,5,False,1,"Somethin' that large cannot hide for long."
1790,2,5,False,1,"The swarmpoint won't be pleased if we come home with empty hands."
1791,2,5,False,1,"I can't see a godsdamned thing!"
1792,2,5,False,1,"You see anythin' over there!?"
1793,2,5,False,1,"Here turtle turtle turtle turtle!"
1794,2,5,False,1,"I'll see you cut from ear to ear!"
1795,2,5,False,1,"Run while you can, outsider!"
1796,2,5,False,1,"Find your own damned turtle!"
1797,2,5,False,1,"This ain't your wood!"
1798,2,5,False,1,"You just wait until we get us a turtle!"
1799,2,5,False,1,"You'd best hope our paths don't cross again!"
1800,2,5,False,1,"Thal's balls!"
1801,2,5,False,1,"Luck was on your side today, outsider, but we'll see about the morrow!"
1802,2,5,False,1,"Bleedin' outsiders!"
1803,2,5,False,1,"Sleep with one eye open tonight, 'venturer. I'll be comin' for you!"
1804,2,5,False,1,"Damned outsider went and frightened off all the damned turtles!"
1805,2,5,False,1,"I ain't tellin' the swarmpoint. You tellin' the swarmpoint?"
1806,2,5,False,1,"I can't even remember what we was lookin' for..."
1807,2,5,False,1,"I ain't tellin' the swarmpoint. You tellin' the swarmpoint?"
1808,2,5,False,1,"I know a place deeper in the wood. Might be we find us a big one there."
1809,2,5,False,1,"What we need is more Redbellies. Let's go back to the Hive."
1810,3,5,False,1,"Arrrggghck!"
1811,3,5,False,1,"Dalamud! My liege! Save me!"
1812,3,5,False,1,"My blood and soul, I give unto thee!"
1813,3,5,False,1,"Ah hah hah! Foolish mortal! I know not of this Dalamud, but if He will not partake in this offering, I claim it as my own!"
1814,2,5,False,1,"Dalamud still thirsts."
1815,2,5,False,1,"Then we shall return on the morrow."
1816,2,5,False,1,"Is that the tusked one?"
1817,2,5,False,1,"It is! The bane of the elder one lives! "
1818,2,5,False,1,"The tusked one must pay!"
1819,2,5,False,1,"The tusked one must answer for crimes against the elder one!"
1820,2,5,False,1,"This one cannot forgive! This one cannot forget!"
1821,2,5,False,1,"O elder one! Give this one the strength to exact vengeance!"
1822,2,5,False,1,"The tusked one is fallen..."
1823,2,5,False,1,"Yet, why does the heart of this one still feel so empty...?"
1824,2,5,False,1,"Come back, tusked one!"
1825,2,5,False,1,"Vengeance still burns in this one's heart!"
1826,3,5,False,1,"Me poor back cannot take another lashin'."
1827,3,5,False,1,"I'm but a porter. My talents are limited to porting...and little else."
1828,3,5,False,1,"I thank you...and my wife thanks you. Or at least she will after tonight! <wink>"
1829,3,5,False,1,"Perhaps I can make it back to an inn..."
1830,3,5,False,1,"You wait. The wine'll be sweet this season!"
1831,3,5,False,1,"<sigh> Mayhap the morrow'll bring better luck."
1832,3,3,False,1,"The golems have the road. We must take it back!"
1833,3,5,False,1,"The stone man wakes! The stone man walks!"
1834,3,5,False,1,"Save us! Save us from the stone man! Save us!"
1835,3,5,False,1,"Back to the mines! Back to the dig!"
1836,3,3,False,1,"The stone man walks!"
1837,3,3,False,1,"No more digging! Much more running!"
1838,3,3,False,1,"Titan, save us! Adventurer, save us!"
1839,3,5,False,1,"Hsss! Sssend the finlesss onesss below!"
1840,3,5,False,1,"Become one with the Whorl!"
1841,3,5,False,1,"O Leviathan! Lend us your strength!"
1842,3,5,False,1,"Leviathan is the one true god!"
1843,3,5,False,1,"Gods! There are so many of them!"
1844,3,5,False,1,"Someone─anyone─call for reinforcements!"
1845,3,5,False,1,"Grenades! They're too close to the plant!"
1846,3,5,False,1,"Close the blast doors! Turn off the pumps!"
1847,3,5,False,1,"No more ceruleum for you!"
1848,3,5,False,1,"There's just no end to these damned things."
1849,2,3,False,1,"I will not be defeated. Not here! Not by the likes of you!"
1850,3,5,False,1,"We have made it this far..."
1851,3,3,False,1,"...but our work has only just begun!"
1852,2,3,False,1,"And what work is that, sir!?"
1853,3,3,False,1,"The work we came here for!"
1854,2,2,False,1,"And that is, sir!?"
1855,3,3,False,1,"The airstones, you half-witted Highlanders!"
1856,2,2,False,1,"Midlanders, sir!"
1857,3,3,False,1,"Gah! To the hells with it! You know what to do!"
1858,2,3,False,1,"And that is, sir!?"
1859,3,3,False,1,"DESTROY THE BLOODY AIRSTONES!"
1860,2,3,False,1,"Sir! Yes, sir!"
1861,3,3,False,1,"Commence the operation!"
1862,2,2,False,1,"Sir!"
1863,2,5,False,1,"I would not believe it if I had not seen it with mine own eyes. "
1864,2,5,False,1,"Hah hah! I was made for this!"
1865,2,5,False,1,"Fall back, you cretins!"
1866,2,5,False,1,"Did we win?"
1867,3,5,False,1,"One-eyed demons to the north! To arms!"
1868,3,5,False,1,"Don't forget to strip the eyes of the lenses. The Alchemists' Guild'll pay good coin for 'em!"
1869,3,5,False,1,"Is there no end to these doblyns!?"
1870,3,5,False,1,"If I had a gil for every doblyn I'd slain...I wouldn't be here slaying cursed doblyns!"
1871,2,3,False,1,"I will fight the sylphs in a location of mine own choosing!"
1872,2,3,False,1,"There is no recourse. We must fight!"
1873,2,3,False,1,"To battle, Dozol goes! Squaaawk!"
1874,2,3,False,1,"We shall prevail─triumph, win, prevail!"
1875,3,5,False,1,"Time to take the hive!"
1876,3,5,False,1,"Spears forward!"
1877,2,3,False,1,"Sting them back, boys!"
1878,2,3,False,1,"Hyah!"
1879,2,3,False,1,"Give us another!"
1880,2,3,False,1,"I'll show you what it means to wail!"
1881,4,5,False,1,"The rancor! It feeds me, yet consumes me!"
1882,3,3,False,1,"Sylphs approaching quickly! Where are my reinforcements!?"
1883,2,5,False,1,"Imperials in the Twelveswood! I must report back to the Adders' Nest at once!"
1884,3,5,False,1,"GRRRRRRAHR! BROTHERS! TO ME!"
1885,2,10,False,1,"For the Empire!"
1886,5,1,False,5,"Another world, another battle..."
1887,5,1,False,5,"Is this my fate? To fight an endless war?"
1888,5,1,False,5,"So be it. It won't be the first time I've spit in destiny's eye."
1889,5,1,False,5,"Come on, then."
1890,2,3,False,1,"Just another obstacle."
1891,2,3,False,1,"That all you got?"
1892,2,3,False,1,"I'll cut you down to size!"
1893,2,3,False,1,"I've fought worse."
1894,2,3,False,1,"Let's get this over with."
1895,5,1,False,5,"Hm? Why can't I─ Well, this is just great..."
1896,5,1,False,5,"You okay? That was some fight, huh? The name's Lightning. I'm not...from around here."
1897,5,1,False,5,"I'm not even sure where “here” is. The last thing I remember, I was sleeping."
1898,5,1,False,5,"I don't know if I'm stuck in this world, or if I'll be sent somewhere else..."
1899,3,5,False,1,"Aaah!"
1900,3,5,False,1,"What manner of fiend is that!?"
1901,3,5,False,1,"Flee while you can!"
1902,3,5,False,1,"Stay back!"
1903,3,5,False,1,"Keep your distance!"
1904,3,5,False,1,"We'll try to hold it here!"
1905,3,5,False,1,"Don't let it come near the city!"
1906,5,1,False,5,"Disengage! You're no match for that thing!"
1907,5,1,False,5,"You can't fight an armored unit without artillery!"
1908,5,1,False,5,"...Well, you get full points for bravery."
1909,5,1,False,5,"Let's see if I can't help turn the tables."
1910,2,3,False,1,"You Eorzeans don't give up, do you?"
1911,2,3,False,1,"Back me up."
1912,2,3,False,1,"Now we're talking."
1913,5,1,False,5,"What's a militarized behemoth even doing here? Did it stumble through some portal?"
1914,5,1,False,5,"Or was it sent after me?"
1915,5,1,False,5,"No! I'm not done with you yet! Dammit..."
1916,3,1,False,5,"The beast is dead!"
1917,3,5,False,1,"Your aid was most timely!"
1918,5,1,False,5,"Strange... I didn't expect to be here after the battle was done."
1919,5,1,False,5,"Might as well take a look around, then."
1920,3,5,False,1,"Aid! Aid, I pray you!"
1921,3,5,False,1,"She can't defeat that abomination alone!"
1922,5,1,False,5,"I have to stop meeting people like this. I'm afraid my company's going to get someone killed."
1923,5,1,False,5,"I'm beginning to understand the reason I was sent to this place: I'm being tested."
1924,5,1,False,5,"Someone woke me up to see how much fight I had left..."
1925,5,1,False,5,"They've come for me."
1926,5,1,False,5,"They want to drag me back to an ancient, dying world and chain me to a god's will."
1927,5,1,False,5,"Come on! Take me if you can! I will not be a slave! "
1928,5,1,False,5,"Where is this chaos energy coming from? I thought we cut off the source, but it seems to be getting stronger..."
1929,5,1,False,5,"If this keeps up, it will overflow into Eorzea."
1930,5,1,False,5,"This deity will stop at nothing to bring me back."
1931,5,1,False,5,"Even if it means corrupting your world with chaos. "
1932,5,1,False,5,"Well, I've seen enough innocents die at the hands of indifferent gods!"
1933,5,1,False,5,"Odin! To me!"
1934,5,1,False,5,"Thank you, Odin."
1935,5,1,False,5,"With any luck, that'll be the last of them."
1936,5,1,False,5,"I don't think we won. Feels more like we were judged...unworthy."
1937,2,5,False,1,"Keep going, kupo!"
1938,2,5,False,1,"Hurry, hurry!"
1939,2,5,False,1,"Faster, kupo, faster!"
1940,2,5,False,1,"Don't leave me, kupo!"
1941,2,5,False,1,"D-Did you hear that!?"
1942,2,5,False,1,"Don't let them hurt me, kupo!"
1943,2,5,False,1,"I can't take this... "
1944,2,5,False,1,"Are we going to die!?"
1945,2,5,False,1,"Have at thee, kupo!"
1946,2,5,False,1,"D-Damn you... "
1947,2,5,False,1,"Impossible!"
1948,2,5,False,1,"I'm not finished with you yet, kupo!"
1949,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1950,2,5,False,1,"That one's mine!"
1951,2,5,False,1,"Bloody hells... "
1952,2,5,False,1,"Gah! That stings, kupo... "
1953,2,5,False,1,"Kupoooooo!"
1954,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1955,2,5,False,1,"Make way, make way!"
1956,2,5,False,1,"Why you... "
1957,2,5,False,1,"Again!? Ugh... "
1958,2,5,False,1,"Leave it to me, kupo!"
1959,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1960,2,5,False,1,"Yer gonna get it! Right in the bum, kupo!"
1961,2,5,False,1,"Ack! Right in me bum, kupo... "
1962,2,5,False,1,"Ack! I'm bad at this... "
1963,2,5,False,1,"Ye can run, but ye can't kupo!"
1964,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1965,2,5,False,1,"You're in big trouble now, kupo!"
1966,2,5,False,1,"Help! I-I'm in trouble..."
1967,2,5,False,1,"I think I need to lay down, kupo... "
1968,2,5,False,1,"Oh, deary me... "
1969,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1970,2,5,False,1,"Bear witness to the glory of kupo!"
1971,2,5,False,1,"What to do, what to do... "
1972,2,5,False,1,"Everyone's so serious, kupo... "
1973,2,5,False,1,"Ever dance with a moogle in the pale moonlight?"
1974,2,5,False,1,"Hmph! Next time won't be so easy!"
1975,2,5,False,1,"Next next time won't be so easy!"
1976,2,5,False,1,"You're in for a treat, kupo!"
1977,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the king, kupo!"
1978,2,5,False,1,"Wait, we're doing this now, kupo?"
1979,2,5,False,1,"Why me, kupo!?"
1980,2,5,False,1,"That's just petty... "
1981,2,5,False,1,"It'll all be over soon, kupo... "
1982,2,5,False,1,"Hail to the kupo─I mean, king!"
1983,2,3,False,1,"You are neither a gentleman nor a zombie!"
1984,2,3,False,1,"Do not disturb our practice!"

I fear I've more important matters to attend to today."
