1,"TEXT_CLSBSM351_00299_SEQ_01","Brithael's love of drink has caught up with him, as he appears to be suffering from a prolonged hangover. Unfortunately, this means that he is in no condition to fill Faezahr's latest commission. Offer your services to the merchant on behalf of the forgemaster."
2,"TEXT_CLSBSM351_00299_SEQ_02","The steel bhuj Faezahr seeks to have forged is intended as a present for his favorite axeman, and he will accept nothing less than the finest quality. Craft the item to the best of your ability and present it to Faezahr for inspection."

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 40."
