2,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SEQ_02","Serendipity explains that, while she can easily repair and replace most mammet components, the cores that contain a mammet's personality and memory are a completely different matter. Thankfully, the failing part is one she can reproduce, so the stalwart assistant should soon be back to normal.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 30."

49,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_2","Recently, he started acting strangely─aye, even by his usual standards."
50,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_3","Anyway, I believe I've determined the cause. It's quite complicated, but to put it simply...he's breaking down."
51,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_4","I can handle the repairs, but I need to count on you for something."
52,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_5","I need you to make an ingot of silver─not any ingot of silver, mind you, but a <Emphasis>high-quality</Emphasis> one."

60,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_13","Poor, poor Gigi. He's like a completely different person."
61,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_14","...What? Not that different than usual, you say?"
62,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_15","Well, it may seem that way to you, but I can assure you he's quite out of sorts. Anyway...silver was historically prized for its beauty. Ancient peoples even believed it to possess magical properties."
63,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_16","Although they did not completely understand the natural processes involved, they were in fact correct. It's difficult to explain to someone without an extensive background in the relevant fields, but let's just say that silver is really, really good at channeling aether."
64,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_17","For this reason, silver is the material of choice for making a mammet's precision parts. Thankfully, the component responsible for Gigi's erratic behavior is within my ability to craft."
65,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_18","But gods forbid that his core should ever be damaged."
66,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_19","...Oh, the core? It's like, well...it's everything that makes Gigi himself. His memories, his personality─his soul, really."
67,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_20","When he was first built over a century ago, he knew nothing. But, by assisting guildmaster after guildmaster, he's come to possess more wisdom and experience than any living goldsmith."
68,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_21","That knowledge...and the gentle soul that carries it, are our guild's greatest treasures."
69,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_22","Heh, I take it you didn't realize just how irreplaceable he is. Believe me, it's been a great comfort having him around."
70,"TEXT_CLSGLD250_00616_SERENDIPITY_000_23","And thanks to you, we can continue to rely on his counsel!"
