49,"TEXT_GAIUSA410_00752_HIHIBARU_000_001","You'll recall my telling you how the Qiqirn have been raiding Highbridge nigh without cease. Well, there is a rumor that those filthy rats have been meeting with a great hulk of a man in secret."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA410_00752_HIHIBARU_000_002","While I can't say whether this is the mystery fellow you seek, I reckon it's as good a lead as any other."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSA410_00752_HIHIBARU_000_031","Gods be good... If I'm reading this right, the Qiqirn are trying to strike a deal with the Amalj'aa. They mean to catch hapless souls at Highbridge and sell them off like sacks of popotoes!"
56,"TEXT_GAIUSA410_00752_HIHIBARU_000_032","To think that different tribes of beastmen are colluding in their villainy... I must warn everyone to maintain vigilance!"
57,"TEXT_GAIUSA410_00752_HIHIBARU_000_033","You have my thanks, adventurer. Had you not braved the Qiqirn lair, no one here would have known what the creatures were plotting until they actually began picking us off, one by one."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSA410_00752_HIHIBARU_000_034","On the other hand...I suppose this means you're no closer to finding your man. Well, unless it's an Amalj'aa you're looking for. But, uh...probably not, huh?"
