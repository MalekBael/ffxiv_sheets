1,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_SEQ_01","In light of your run-in with an Ala Mhigan bandit, Hihibaru recommends that you next take your investigation to Little Ala Mhigo. His daughter, a lass named Hihira, has taken up residence there, and should be able to lend you a hand."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_SEQ_02","Hihira has no knowledge of Lahabrea. She recommends you speak with a man named Gundobald, the leader of the refugee settlement."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_SEQ_03","As forewarned, you receive a cold welcome from Gundobald. It seems that some effort will be required on your part if the residents of Little Ala Mhigo are to warm to you."

49,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_HIHIBARU_000_001","So, it stands to reason that if you want to pick up the trail again, you should head toward Little Ala Mhigo, over in southern Thanalan."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_HIHIBARU_000_002","Just so you know what to expect, the settlement is the favored destination for those refugees who couldn't...well, <Emphasis>adapt</Emphasis> to life in Ul'dah."
51,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_HIHIBARU_000_003","The hearts of the denizens are said to be as barren as the wasteland they live in. And for all intents and purposes, it's a lawless place. Be prepared for a not-so-warm welcome."

53,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_HIHIBARU_000_005","And while you have her attention...I'd be obliged if you could send my love. Not a day goes by that I don't think of her."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_HIHIRA_000_010","...Hm? Why, yes, Hihibaru's my father... He said <Emphasis>what</Emphasis>?
<sigh> I wish I could be a better daughter to him. It's just that— Oh, I'm sorry... I shouldn't bother you with family matters. But I am grateful to you for delivering the message. Now then, what brings you here?"
56,"TEXT_GAIUSA505_00757_HIHIRA_000_011","A masked man? I'm afraid the description doesn't ring any bells, but one of the others here may have seen something. I would recommend you first speak with Gundobald, the leader of the settlement. I must warn you, though, he isn't exactly...accommodating to outsiders."
