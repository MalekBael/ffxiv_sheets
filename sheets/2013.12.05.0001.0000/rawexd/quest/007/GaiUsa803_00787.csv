Rumors have arisen that, in death, their rancor has gone into a rock to the southwest, causing it to flash and moan. Hopeful for a clue, Aideen bids you use a firesand stick to blow off pieces of the rock, and then bring back the fragments for her to examine."

55,"TEXT_GAIUSA803_00787_AIDEEN_000_032","I almost hate to say it, but that explains the flashing and moaning. Nothing to do with the masked stranger. Looks like I've gone and wasted both your time <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> a perfectly good firesand stick. Oh, well..."
