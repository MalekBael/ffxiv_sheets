1,"TEXT_GAIUSA904_00799_SEQ_01","While uncertain for a time, Ivaurault is now convinced that it was a winged eyeball that he encountered at the rocky area to the west. There may well be another victim out there, waiting to be discovered. The three friends would leave the task of investigating to the expert─you."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSA904_00799_SEQ_02","As the three friends had feared, there was indeed another victim. The authorities must be informed. Bear your grisly find back to Fallgourd Float, and show it to Aethelmaer."
