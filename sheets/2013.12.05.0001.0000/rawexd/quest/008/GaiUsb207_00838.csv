1,"TEXT_GAIUSB207_00838_SEQ_01","Fyrilsunn has told you that he has recently misplaced something of great value to him—three medals engraved with the image of a lion. Help out the distraught Roegadyn by searching for the medals around where he last saw them. He has suggested you begin by standing /lookout at the top of Gullperch Tower."

3,"TEXT_GAIUSB207_00838_SEQ_03","You have found the lost medals. Return them to Fyrilsunn in Costa del Sol."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSB207_00838_SEQ_04","It turns out that the medals are Fyrilsunn's only remaining material connection to friends lost in a previous war. While he is grateful to have them back, the mementos also seem to make him wary of inevitable future conflicts."
