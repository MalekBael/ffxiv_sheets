1,"TEXT_GAIUSB704_00899_SEQ_01","House Fortemps has placed a reward on the heads of snow wolves responsible for attacks on the supply train. Though not even yearlings, the beasts are vicious and have a taste for man-flesh. Slay four wolves and skin them as proof of your deed."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSB704_00899_SEQ_02","Where there were four wolves, there are now four pelts and a churn of red snow. You have scoured the blood from your hands, and are now ready to return to Corentiaux with the proof."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSB704_00899_SEQ_03","Many in the High Houses prefer to leave problems unsolved rather than ask for assistance from adventurers─especially when the problem is a lowly predator and the prey is a lowly servant or ten.
