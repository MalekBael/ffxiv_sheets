1,"TEXT_GAIUSB911_00934_SEQ_01","The heretic Boyle demands a sacrifice to offer to the dragons. This stretches even the very elastic definition of an adventurer's trade, but the imprisoned madman excites your pity. Ferdillaix may know if something can be done."

4,"TEXT_GAIUSB911_00934_SEQ_04","Ferdillaix grouses about the din caused by Boyle. It does seem inconvenient that in exposing a man's heresy, the inquisitors also make him loud and more than a little mad. However, no good can come of humoring unbelievers or criticizing the inquisitors..."
