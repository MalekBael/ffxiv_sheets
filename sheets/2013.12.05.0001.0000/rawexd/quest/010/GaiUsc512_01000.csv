1,"TEXT_GAIUSC512_01000_SEQ_01","According to Guolgeim, the wreck of the Garlean airship continues to yield small prizes for scavengers such as herself, from time to time. Go southeast and comb the crash site for pieces of airship hull."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSC512_01000_SEQ_02","You collect eight hull fragments, all of good weight. Do as Guolgeim bid and show them to Wandering Breeze over at Saint Coinach's Find."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSC512_01000_SEQ_03","What you found were pieces of Garlean armor plating made of cermet, an alloy unknown to Eorzea─and all but proof against anything she could hurl against it. Report what you learned to Guolgeim."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSC512_01000_SEQ_04","It seems Guolgeim has excellent armor herself, for she is indifferent to the importance of unlocking the secret of the alloy. However, the adventurer is delighted by the prospect of profit, for she is in arrears─and to Wandering Breeze, of all people."
