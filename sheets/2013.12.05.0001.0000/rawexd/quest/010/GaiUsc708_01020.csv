49,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_BLOEIDIN_000_001","In a perfect world, the mere word of our triumph would convince any pirate captain still sailing aimlessly in search of treasure to quit their plundering and fight the good fight. But I know as well as any that coin is the quickest─and ofttimes the only, aye─way to a pirate's heart."
50,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_BLOEIDIN_000_002","I've drafted a full report of the operation, along with the suggestion that the Maelstrom institute generous rewards for any pirate─be he captain, cook, or swab─who contributes to their cause.

56,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_SLAFSWYS_000_020","The seas have carried ye back to me, I see. I've caught wind of me erstwhile mateys' triumph, and your contributions as well. Ye'd 'ave made for a fine pirate yerself, aye."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_SLAFSWYS_000_021","Bringin' the pirates together with promises of treasure and glory─that's the Bloeidin I know, aye. And from what I hear, it's already caught the ear of many a buccaneer."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_SLAFSWYS_000_022","Bloeidin and I go back a ways, we do. We were comrades, friends, and─aye─even more than that on occasion, if me memory serves."

60,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_SLAFSWYS_000_024","Treasure and glory are all well and good, but do ye know what truly calls a pirate to the open sea? Freedom. And that's somethin' that the Maelstrom can never offer."
61,"TEXT_GAIUSC708_01020_SLAFSWYS_000_025","But I can only hope that others of my kind answer the call, aye. Then─and only then─can I be sure that my decision to part with my Yellowjacket comrades was the right one."
