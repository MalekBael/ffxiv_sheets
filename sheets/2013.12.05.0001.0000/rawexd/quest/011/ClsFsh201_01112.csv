1,"TEXT_CLSFSH201_01112_SEQ_01","While Chuchuroon is capable of catching fish himself, he lacks the patience to do so without first consuming his supply of bait. To show him that lures can be just as effective as live bait, Sisipu would have catching five warmwater trout off the shores of Oakwood in upper La Noscea using crow flies. When you've done so, show Chuchuroon your catch."

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 25."
