1,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SEQ_01","Using the technique the acting guildmaster has termed “fishwheeling” (more widely known as mooching), you are to use a crayfish ball to catch a high-quality striped goby, and then recast the goby in order to catch a shadow catfish. The fish can be found in the waters surrounding Fallgourd Float in the North Shroud."
2,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SEQ_02","Sisipu expresses her gratitude for the shadow catfish and seems genuinely impressed by how far you have come in the field of fishing.

※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 30."

49,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_001","So when he comes asking for shadow catfish, no other fish will do, even if I kindly explain that fishing one out involves an arduous journey to Fallgourd Float followed by grueling labor. Naturally, I thought of you for the task."
50,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_002","This will likely require a bit of “fishwheeling,” if you know what I mean, though I imagine you do not, as I just invented that word. It means catching fish to use as bait for a fish, then recasting that fish as bait for a yet larger fish."
51,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_003","In my wisdom, I have deemed that your fishing prowess, land-faring acumen, and physical presence directly in front of me qualify you as the ideal candidate for the job."

54,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_006","Take it from the inventor of fishwheeling: since the striped goby will become your lure, you'll want to catch the biggest, shiniest one you can find."
55,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_007","A long journey lies ahead of you, and I fear the guild will not be the same in your absence. However, I choose to think of it not as losing a friend, but gaining a shadow catfish. Good luck!"
56,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SYSTEM_000_008","Fishwheeling, or <Color(-34022)>mooching</Color> as it is more widely known, involves catching a high-quality fish and then recasting your line with the fish still on it in an attempt to land even larger prey.

57,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_010","You'll find the catfish you seek at Fallgourd Float in the North Shroud. Mayhap it's a tad presumptuous to say you <Emphasis>will</Emphasis> find one, but that's where they are, at any rate."

62,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_015","Still, I don't see what all the fuss is about. For all the lengths one need travel and dangers one need brave, the fish tastes little better than mud..."
63,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_WAWALAGO_000_016","Pssst! Pardon me, but perhaps I might persuade you to prepare them in a proper bath? Water washes off the waste you can wipe away, but the invisible vapors only vanish with vinegar! You must mind the mud you can't see."

67,"TEXT_CLSFSH251_01113_SISIPU_000_020","But that is neither here nor there. <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>─There are few fishermen who could haul in the catch you did today."
