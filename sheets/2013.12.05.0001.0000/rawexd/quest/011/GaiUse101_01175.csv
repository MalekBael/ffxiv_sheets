1,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_SEQ_01","Your victory over Gaius van Baelsar has garnered the Scions unprecedented fame. Alas, this has led to a sharp increase in petitioners seeking to obtain their services for personal gain. Although she is loath to enter into questionable arrangements, Minfilia posits that they may ultimately empower the Scions to do greater good. However, before she agrees to any such proposal, she would like to hear the opinions of the other Scions. Speak with Thancred, Y'shtola, Yda, Papalymo and Urianger."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_SEQ_02","Unsurprisingly, the other Scions have concerns about this potential course of action. Speak with Alphinaud about the situation and see what he has to say."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_SEQ_03","Alphinaud seizes the opportunity to present to Minfilia a bold proposal: move the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to Mor Dhona, beyond the borders of Ul'dah and the other great nations. Though she permits him to explain his reasoning in full, Minfilia decries his idea as beyond reckless, and dismisses him without further discussion. As you silently watch Alphinaud take his leave, you sense that, beneath their heated words, another conversation was taking place..."

70,"TEXT_GAIUSE101_01175_YSHTOLA_101_022","It was never my intent to debate─merely to state the truth. The Lominsans broke the treaty, and the kobolds responded. The cycle perpetuated, escalated, and we were called to intervene."
