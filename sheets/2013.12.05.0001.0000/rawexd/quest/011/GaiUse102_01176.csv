0,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_00","Minfilia does not seem to be aware of your presence."
1,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_01","Desiring to be left alone with her thoughts, Minfilia bids you assist Alphinaud with an unknown task. Respect the Antecedent's wishes and attend to Alphinaud outside the solar."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_02","According to Alphinaud, Minfilia's visceral rejection of his proposal is due entirely to an irrational hope─her adopted mother, F'lhaminn, long believed dead, is rumored to be alive and well. Believing that Minfilia will remain uncooperative until the rumors are proven false, Alphinaud asks you to help with his investigation. Speak with Father Iliud at the Church of Saint Adama Landama to learn the source of one such rumor."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_03","Father Iliud does not claim to have seen F'lhaminn, only to have heard the story from a visiting mourner. Fortunately, the man has yet to depart. Seek him out in the lichyard and hear his testimony."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_04","The man is supremely confident that the woman he spied in Costa del Sol was F'lhaminn, despite having last seen the famous performer nearly seven years ago. It may be prudent, however, to see if Father Iliud also found him convincing."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_SEQ_05","Without proof, it is impossible to determine the veracity of the man's statements. Nevertheless, he has given you a location, and Father Iliud believes it merits further investigation."

52,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_MINFILIA_000_004","Tell him he will have my response in due time."
53,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_010","Confound it. She knows it must be done, and yet she hesitates."
54,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_011","All because of baseless rumors which are clouding her judgment."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_012","I should explain. Minfilia's mother─well, adopted mother─perished in the Calamity."
56,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_013","F'lhaminn, the Songstress of Ul'dah, beloved by all─including our resident minstrel."
57,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_014","Naturally, her adoring fans wanted desperately to believe she still lived. That her body was never found only fueled speculation."
58,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_015","Minfilia, too, struggled to accept the truth, but in time she saw that there could be no other explanation."
59,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_016","Until now, that is. For whatever reason, rumors of F'lhaminn alive and well have once again begun to spread."
60,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_017","Alas, these rumors have reached Minfilia's ears, rekindling within her an irrational hope. This talk of Ul'dah as our home, that we would be plagued with insurmountable difficulties should we relocate─utter nonsense. But until we conclusively prove that her mother is no longer with us, I fear she will remain uncooperative."
61,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_018","So we will investigate, as she requests."
62,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ALPHINAUD_000_019","One of these most recent rumors comes to us by way of Father Iliud, whom I would have you speak with on my behalf, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I shall look into other sightings and follow anon."

Alphinaud told me to expect you."
64,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ILIUD_000_031","I myself did not see F'lhaminn, though I very much wish I had. 'Twas a visitor to the lichyard who spoke of her to me."
65,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ILIUD_000_032","He is still here, if you wish to hear his tale for yourself. You should find him just outside."
66,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_GRAVEMAN_000_040","F'lhaminn? Yes, of course it was her─I'm sure of it! I could <Emphasis>never</Emphasis> forget a woman like that!"
67,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_GRAVEMAN_000_041","Gods, just thinking of that moment when I first laid eyes on her, nigh on seven years ago─"
68,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_GRAVEMAN_000_042","And those years have only made her more refined and radiant!"
69,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_GRAVEMAN_000_043","Where did I─? Oh, Costa del Sol! She was giving lessons to Gegeruju's women, and her voice─the soft tinkling of bells that resonated in my soul."
70,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_GRAVEMAN_000_044","I dare not say how her songs touched me..."
71,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_GRAVEMAN_000_045","No one's ever made me feel this way before─except for <Emphasis>you</Emphasis>, my dear, of course. But she's out there, somewhere, and you're...well...you've been down <Emphasis>there</Emphasis> for the past year, so..."
72,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ILIUD_000_050","He seemed awfully sure, though I do wonder..."
73,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ILIUD_000_051","I doubt I would recognize someone I barely knew whom I hadn't seen in seven years."
74,"TEXT_GAIUSE102_01176_ILIUD_000_052","But if there is even the slightest possibility that F'lhaminn yet lives, we must pursue it for Minfilia's sake."
