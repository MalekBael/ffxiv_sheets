1,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_01","Father Iliud reasons that, if F'lhaminn had indeed been employed at Costa del Sol, Master Gegeruju should know her whereabouts. Make haste to eastern La Noscea and seek an audience with the wealthy Lalafell."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_02","A heartbroken Gegeruju is further dismayed to learn that the object of his affections, who only recently left, was the famous Songstress of Ul'dah. Though he recalls her declaring a desire to visit Wineport, he assures you that F'lhaminn will inevitably tire of her rugged lifestyle and return to his waiting arms. Providing you do not share his optimism, journey to Wineport and question the local residents."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_03","Your cursory investigation yields a promising lead, provided by the incorrigible wine baron of Limsa Lominsa. A woman matching F'lhaminn's description visited Byrglaent's winery, but, finding her perfume to be intolerable, he expelled her from the premises. Though he has no inkling of where she went next, the wine baron suggests that you consult with Shamani Lohmani, reasoning that his unique talents may enable him to track the perfumed lady."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_04","Shamani Lohmani vividly recalls the woman's scent, as well as a conversation he had with her not long ago. After observing that her perfume was reminiscent of a local species of flower, she asked him where she might find the most pristine specimens. He obliged, and she presumably followed his directions south into Raincatcher Gully. With luck, she may still be there."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_05","You successfully locate the woman mere moments before a ravenous goobbue emerges from the forest, seemingly intent on devouring you both. Fortunately, it proves to be no match. All that remains is to verify the identity of the perfumed lady."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_06","Regarding you with suspicion at first, the woman eventually admits that she is F'lhaminn. Joined by Alphinaud, the three of you agree to return to Wineport, where your conversation can be continued in safety."
7,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SEQ_07","Alphinaud informs you that, despite his best efforts, F'lhaminn refuses to return to Ul'dah until she has completed her perfume. Left with no other option, he asks you to assist her in whatever ways necessary."

54,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_GEGERUJU_000_013","Ahem! An exaggeration for dramatic effect. As to her current whereabouts, I recall she mentioned Wineport. Ah, but there is no need to go, my friend! When she tires of her pedestrian lifestyle, she will doubtless come running headlong into my arms, breathless..."
55,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_JUNGHBHAR_000_020","What? Have <Emphasis>I</Emphasis> seen a Miqo'te lass by the name of F'lhaminn? I wish! There're far too few women in my life right now, that's for damn sure..."

60,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_041","The girl? One does not forget a perfume like that. So robust and intoxicating, yet familiar. Reminiscent of a flower native to Raincatcher Gully, in fact."
61,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_042","I said as much when we spoke not long ago. She praised my observational skills and asked where she might find those selfsame flowers."
62,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_043","So I told her to follow the road south towards lower La Noscea and head east after crossing the second bridge. Those which grow in the shade of the cliff have the strongest odor, you see. If you make haste, you may yet find her there."
63,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_SHAMANILOHMANI_000_044","You are not far behind. Make haste to the second bridge, then head due east. Look for the flowers which grow in the shade of the cliff, and with luck you may yet find her."

71,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_057","Most Ul'dahns think you dead, yet here you stand alive and well."
72,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_058","I can only conclude that this was by design. The question is: why?"
73,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_FLHAMINN_000_059","Not everyone who endeavors to find me does so with the best intentions, child."

76,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_FLHAMINN_000_062","Because I deem it so. As I began telling your associate prior to your intrusion, I came to harvest these flowers for a perfume. Does that satisfy your curiosity, or would you interrogate me further?"
77,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_063","M-My apologies for the interruption. Well then─now that you have them, might we continue this conversation in a safer locale, say, Wineport?"
78,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_064","Then it's settled. To Wineport, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>!"
79,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_FLHAMINN_000_065","Yes, this will do nicely..."
80,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_070","This is...this is <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> at all what I expected..."
81,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_071","Miss F'lhaminn has been apprised of our situation, and has agreed to help us persuade Minfilia to relocate the Scions."
82,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_072","However, she will <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> do so until her perfume is complete, and she <Emphasis>insists</Emphasis> that we help her obtain the final component."
83,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_073","She will not be swayed. I assure you, I tried."
84,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_ALPHINAUD_000_074","...Let's just get this over with, shall we?"
85,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_FLHAMINN_000_080","Rescued yet again from the jaws of a ravenous goobbue. How quickly we forget the lessons of the past."
86,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_FLHAMINN_000_081","<sigh> Though he too was to blame for that foolishness..."
87,"TEXT_GAIUSE103_01177_POP_MESSAGE","Something massive this way trundles!"
