1,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_01","The remaining ingredient F'lhaminn requires is pristine salamander oil, which can only be obtained from the belly of a gurangatch, which dwell in upper La Noscea's Bronze Lake. However, the wavekin are notoriously elusive, and must be lured out of hiding if they are to be slain. Journey to Bronze Lake and slay three mud pugils for this purpose."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_02","Gazing upon the foul-smelling pugil carcasses is enough to deprive you of any lingering appetite. Hopefully the gurangatch will regard them more favorably. Place them at the water's edge in gurangatch territory so that you may find out."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_03","The trap is set, and you need only wait. Retreat to a safe distance and bide your time."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_04","The pugil carcasses prove irresistible to a gigantic gurangatch, which you promptly slay in a mighty struggle. As you scrape the belly oil into a flask, you ponder what sort of individual first attempted to use the secretions in perfume. Push such irrelevant musings aside and deliver the oil to F'lhaminn in Wineport."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_05","F'lhaminn requires only a brief moment to finish her perfume. Her preparations complete, she agrees to accompany you and Alphinaud to Vesper Bay. Return to the Waking Sands and seek an audience with Minfilia."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE104_01178_SEQ_06","Upon seeing Alphinaud escort F'lhaminn into the Solar, Minfilia rushes forward to embrace her long-lost mother, overjoyed to learn that the rumors were true. During their tearful reunion, Minfilia explains that her father was once a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, and that following his death in a tragic accident, F'lhaminn raised her as her own. Praising Minfilia for her victories against the Empire, F'lhaminn states that the Scions must leave Ul'dah behind if they are to continue their work. Agreeing at last to Alphinaud's proposal, an invigorated Minfilia declares that the Scions shall move their base of operations to Revenant's Toll."
