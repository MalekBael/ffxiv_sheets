1,"TEXT_GAIUSE107_01181_SEQ_01","The wagon's usual route brings it within shouting─and mug-raising─distance of the Fallgourd Float, if Guolgeim's tart comment is any indication. See if the Wood Wailers at the Float know more of this matter."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE107_01181_SEQ_02","You find the Wailers somewhat distracted, having just received word of an Ixali attack on a wagon. The duty officer doubts that it is the selfsame wagon you seek, but you know there are no coincidences in the North Shroud. Another of the Float's Wailers is on the scene, a road to the east, if you wish to inquire further."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE107_01181_SEQ_03","You arrive only to be informed that it was indeed a supply wagon that was attacked, and both the cargo and the drivers were captured. You are vindicated, but a difficult rescue-and-recovery mission is indicated. To the logging grounds you must go, to free the two captives and recover 3 crates of looted supplies."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE107_01181_SEQ_04","You successfully liberated two people and several crates of cargo. Only the drivers can tell you whether Revenant's Toll will get its supplies. Return to the road east of the Fallgourd Float and speak to the Elezen."
5,"TEXT_GAIUSE107_01181_SEQ_05","You discover that the wagon is too damaged for the supply run to continue on to Revenant's Toll. Guolgeim will not be please to hear it, but still, things could have been much worse. Return with due optimism to the Toll and make your report to Guolgeim."
6,"TEXT_GAIUSE107_01181_SEQ_06","Your optimism turns out to have been justified, for Guolgeim was expecting far worse news. As a denizen of the Toll, she is privy to all manner of rumors, including persistent whispers of the Primals' return…"
