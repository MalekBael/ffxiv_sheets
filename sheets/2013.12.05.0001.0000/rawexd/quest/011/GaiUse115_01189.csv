2,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_SEQ_02","Good King Moggle Mog, the Twelfth of His Name, has returned to Gridania after a five-year absence. Though the precise nature of the mythical being is debatable, all present agree that the danger he poses is akin to that posed by a primal. Resolved, Kan–E–Senna beseeches you to undertake this momentous mission, directing you to consult with Brother E–Sumi–Yan as to how you might breach the king's magical defenses."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_SEQ_03","Brother E–Sumi–Yan takes great comfort in your arrival, observing that the influence of Good King Moggle Mog XII could forever corrupt his people's peaceful nature.

83,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_KUPLOKOPP_000_043","The Mogglesguard only wants to protect the forest from outsiders, but ever since Good King Moggle Mog XII─may his boundless grace fill our hearts with love─returned, they've gotten a little carried away, kupo."
84,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_YDA_000_044","Like the sylphs who summoned Ramuh?"
85,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_PAPALYMO_000_045","We cannot discount the possibility that this entity is influencing the moogles in a manner similar to a primal."
86,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_KANESENNA_000_050","That too is our concern."
87,"TEXT_GAIUSE115_01189_KANESENNA_000_051","Regardless of what one deigns to call the king, we believe he poses a threat not only to mooglekind, but to the whole of Gridania.
