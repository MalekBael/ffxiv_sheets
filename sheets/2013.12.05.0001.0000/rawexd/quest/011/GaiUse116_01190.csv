1,"TEXT_GAIUSE116_01190_SEQ_01","The sanctuary of Good King Moggle Mog XII is protected by magical wards, which can only be nullified through the use of keystones. Fortuitously, these keystones are in the possession the selfsame moogle who warned Gridania of the king's coming. Gaining entrance to Thornmarch should thus prove simple─assuming you can persuade Kuplo Kopp to take a more active role in betraying his brethren."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE116_01190_SEQ_02","With a heavy heart, Kuplo Kopp consents to your plan, and bids you take the ferry to Sweetbloom Pier. Rendezvous with the moogle in the North Shroud as requested."

Fearing that violence might erupt momentarily, you rush to Kuplo Kopp's defense. The three Mogglesguard eventually leave in peace, though not before one insinuates that all who defy the king's will shall soon face a terrible reckoning─a threat which Kuplo Kopp thereafter confirms, to your dismay. Speak with the moogle once more to learn where the king's sanctuary may be found."

9,"TEXT_GAIUSE116_01190_SEQ_09","An ecstatic Kuplo Kopp greets you upon your return, relieved that the king and his Mogglesguard were stopped before their plans were carried out. He then asks that you bear word of your victory to Kupuni Paku, who is in the company of Raya–O–Senna at Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud."
