1,"TEXT_GAIUSE117_01191_SEQ_01","Raya–O–Senna declares that your service on behalf of the Twelveswood shall not be forgotten. Certain that her sister would be glad to learn of Good King Moggle Mog XII's defeat from the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> responsible, she advises you to return to the Lotus Stand in Old Gridania."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE117_01191_SEQ_02","Your eloquent description of the events in Thornmarch serve to confirm the worst fears of the Elder Seedseer and your fellow Scions: like the primals summoned throughout Eorzea, Good King Moggle Mog XII was called forth through means imparted to the Mogglesguard by the Ascians. While he and Yda remain in Gridania to discuss the particulars of the Scion's compensation with the Elder Seedseer, Papalymo bids you return to the Waking Sands and report to Minfilia."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE117_01191_SEQ_03","Minfilia is eager to hear your version of events, despite being well aware of your victory. Alas, she too is forced to conclude that Ascians were behind the king's appearance, both now and before. Though unfortunate, Minfilia acknowledges that the incident provided an opportunity to further demonstrate the necessity of the Scions and thus persuade the Elder Seedseer to proffer additional support─support which will only grow more valuable in the times ahead."
