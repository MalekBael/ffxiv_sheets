1,"TEXT_GAIUSE119_01193_SEQ_01","Minfilia's father, Warburton, was a Garlean spy whose true loyalties lay with the Ala Mhigan Resistance. Before his death in Ul'dah fifteen years ago, he stole a wealth of information on the primals from the Empire, which he then compiled in his private journal. Though this journal has served to guide Minfilia for many years, she has─with great difficulty─resolved to entrust it to Urianger, who she hopes will unravel its remaining mysteries. Give Warburton's journal to Urianger on Minfilia's behalf."
2,"TEXT_GAIUSE119_01193_SEQ_02","By curious coincidence, Minfilia contacts you via linkpearl immediately after you deliver the journal to Urianger. She has already arrived in Revenant's Toll, and bids you follow at earliest convenience. Once you arrive, speak with Tataru inside the Seventh Heaven to gain entrance to the Rising Stones."
3,"TEXT_GAIUSE119_01193_SEQ_03","Tataru welcomes you warmly as always, assuring you that the facilities will more than meet with your expectations. Take a moment to explore the Rising Stones, and speak with Minfilia when you are finished."
4,"TEXT_GAIUSE119_01193_SEQ_04","As the Scions of the Seventh Dawn celebrate the inauguration of the Rising Stones, Urianger arrives unannounced, bearing troubling news. The distant yet dependable Students of Baldesion are no longer responding to his messages. Fearing the worst, Minfilia bids Urianger do everything he can to determine the cause of their prolonged silence. For the time being, the Scions must face future challenges without their invaluable ally."
