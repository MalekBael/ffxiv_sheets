1,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_01","Though unconvinced that searching for the “bumbling one” is worth the trouble, Olmxio nevertheless offers you knowledge that should avail you in your effort. Travel to Larkscall, on the border with the Sylphlands, and survey the area from the specified location."

All present fear for what might befall the realm if the Chosen One were to fall in the hands of the nasty ones. Speak with Olmxio and see if there is aught that can be done."
5,"TEXT_BANSYL002_01253_SEQ_05","Olmxio, expressing grave doubts as to Voyce's abilities, would have you lead the search for the Chosen One. Remain in Little Solace and assist the sylphs as you gather what knowledge you can to prepare for the task ahead."
